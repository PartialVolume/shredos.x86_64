# Config.in.legacy - support for backward compatibility
#
# When an existing Config.in symbol is removed, it should be added again in
# this file, and take appropriate action to approximate backward compatibility.
# This will make the transition for the user more convenient.
#
# When adding legacy symbols to this file, add them to the front. The oldest
# symbols will be removed again after about two years.
#
# The symbol should be copied as-is from the place where it was previously
# defined, but the help text should be removed or replaced with something that
# explains how to fix it.
#
# For bool options, the old symbol should select BR2_LEGACY, so that the user
# is informed at build-time about selected legacy options.
# If there is an equivalent (set of) new symbols, these should be select'ed by
# the old symbol for backwards compatibility.
# It is not possible to select an option that is part of a choice. In that
# case, the new option should use the old symbol as default. This requires a
# change outside of Config.in.legacy, and this should be clearly marked as such
# in a comment, so that removal of legacy options also include the removal of
# these external references.
#
# [Example: renaming a bool option that is part of a choice from FOO to BAR]
# original choice:
# 	choice
# 		prompt "Choose foobar"
# 	config BR2_FOO_1
#		bool "foobar 1"
# 	config BR2_FOO_2
# 		bool "foobar 2"
# 	endchoice
#
# becomes:
#   choice
#   	prompt "Choose foobar"
#   	default BR2_BAR_1 if BR2_FOO_1 # legacy
#   	default BR2_BAR_2 if BR2_FOO_2 # legacy
#   config BR2_BAR_1
#		bool "foobar 1"
#   config BR2_BAR_2
#   	bool "foobar 2"
#   endchoice
#
# and in Config.in.legacy:
#   config BR2_FOO_1
#   	bool "foobar 1 has been renamed"
#   	help
#   	  <suitable help text>
#   # Note: BR2_FOO_1 is still referenced from package/foo/Config.in
#   config BR2_FOO_2
#   	bool "foobar 2 has been renamed"
#   	help
#   	  <suitable help text>
#   # Note: BR2_FOO_2 is still referenced from package/foo/Config.in
#
# [End of example]
#
# For string options, it is not possible to directly select another symbol. In
# this case, a hidden wrap bool option has to be added, that defaults to y if
# the old string is not set at its default value. The wrap symbol should select
# BR2_LEGACY.
# If the original symbol has been renamed, the new symbol should use the value
# of the old symbol as default. Like for choice options, a comment should be
# added to flag that the symbol is still used in another file.
#
# [Example: renaming a string option from FOO to BAR]
# original symbol:
#   config BR2_FOO_STRING
#   	string "Some foo string"
#
# becomes:
#   config BR2_BAR_STRING
#   	string "Some bar string"
#   	default BR2_FOO_STRING if BR2_FOO_STRING != ""  # legacy
#
# and in Config.in.legacy:
#   config BR2_FOO_STRING
#   	string "The foo string has been renamed"
#   	help
#   	  <suitable help text>
#
#   config BR2_FOO_STRING_WRAP

#   	default y if BR2_FOO_STRING != ""
#   	select BR2_LEGACY
