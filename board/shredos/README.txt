ShredOS is a USB bootable (BIOS or UEFI) small linux distribution with the sole
purpose of securely erasing the entire contents of your disks using the program
nwipe. If you are familiar with dwipe from DBAN then you will feel right at
home with ShredOS and nwipe. What are the advantages of nwipe over dwipe/DBAN?
Well as everybody probably knows, DBAN development stopped in 2015 which means
it has not received any further bug fixes or support for new hardware since
that date. Nwipe originally was a fork of dwipe but has continued to have
improvements and bug fixes and is now available in many Linux distros. ShredOS
hopefully will always provide the latest nwipe on a up to date Linux kernel so
it will support modern hardware.
