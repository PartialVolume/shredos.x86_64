Subject: [PATCH] commands/menuentry: Fix quoting in setparams_prefix()

Commit 9acdcbf32542 (use single quotes in menuentry setparams command)
says that expressing a quoted single quote will require 3 characters. It
actually requires (and always did require!) 4 characters:

  str: a'b => a'\''b
  len:  3  => 6 (2 for the letters + 4 for the quote)

This leads to not allocating enough memory and thus out of bounds writes
that have been observed to cause heap corruption.

Allocate 4 bytes for each single quote.

Commit 22e7dbb2bb81 (Fix quoting in legacy parser.) does the same
quoting, but it adds 3 as extra overhead on top of the single byte that
the quote already needs. So it's correct.

Fixes: 9acdcbf32542 (use single quotes in menuentry setparams command)
Fixes: CVE-2021-20233
