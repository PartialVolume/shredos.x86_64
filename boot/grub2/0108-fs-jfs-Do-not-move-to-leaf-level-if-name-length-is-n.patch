Subject: [PATCH] fs/jfs: Do not move to leaf level if name length is negative

Fuzzing JFS revealed crashes where a negative number would be passed
to le_to_cpu16_copy(). There it would be cast to a large positive number
and the copy would read and write off the end of the respective buffers.

Catch this at the top as well as the bottom of the loop.
