Subject: [PATCH] io/gzio: Catch missing values in huft_build() and bail

In huft_build(), "v" is a table of values in order of bit length.
The code later (when setting up table entries in "r") assumes that all
elements of this array corresponding to a code are initialized and less
than N_MAX. However, it doesn't enforce this.

With sufficiently manipulated inputs (e.g. from fuzzing), there can be
elements of "v" that are not filled. Therefore a lookup into "e" or "d"
will use an uninitialized value. This can lead to an invalid/OOB read on
those values, often leading to a crash.
