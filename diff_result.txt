 ShredOS supports either 32bit or 64bit processors. You will need to download the appropriate 64bit or 32bit .img or .iso file, depending upon your target processor and whether you want to burn ShredOS to a USB memory stick, in which case you would download the .img file. Alternatively, if you wanted to burn ShredOS to CD/DVD, then you would download the .iso file.
 
-ShredOS can be used as a software image and booted from PXE capable systems from a PXE server.

 ShredOS includes the latest Nwipe official release, but in addition includes other disc related utilities such as Smartmontools, hdparm, a hexeditor [hexedit](https://linux.die.net/man/1/hexedit), and, the program loadkeys which can be used for [setting the keyboard layout](https://github.com/PartialVolume/shredos.2020.02/blob/master/README.md#how-to-set-the-keyboard-map-using-the-loadkeys-command-see-here-for-persistent-change-between-reboots). Nwipe automatically starts it's GUI in the first virtual terminal (ALT-F1), hdparm, smartmontools and hexeditor can be run in the second virtual terminal, (ALT-F2). Nwipe will erase drives using a user selectable choice of seven methods. hdparm - amongst many of its options - can be used for wiping a drive by [issueing ATA erase commands to the drive's internal firmware](https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase). This is a planned feature addition to nwipe.
 
 ShredOS boots very quickly and depending upon the host system can boot in as little as 2 seconds (typically 4 to 6 seconds) on modern hardware, while on an old Pentium4 may take 40+ seconds. Nwipe automatically starts in GUI mode and will list the disks present on the host system. In fact, Nwipe can launch so fast that the USB devices have not yet initialised so the first time nwipe appears it may not show any USB drives. If you then use Control-C to exit and restart nwipe, you should now see any attached USB devices. You can then select the methods by which you want to securely erase the disk/s. Nwipe is able to simultanuosly wipe multiple disks using a threaded software architecture. I have simultaneously wiped 28 loop devices in tests and know of instances where it's been used to wipe upwards of 10 drives on a system.

-## How to wipe drives on headless systems or systems with faulty display hardware. (For use on secure LANs only)
-ShredOS includes a user enabled telnet server. The downloadable .img images are supplied with telnet disabled as default.
-		
-To enable the telnet server, edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg or/and /EFI/BOOT/grub.cfg and on the USB flash drive, add `telnetd=enable` to the kernel command line.
-
-Example:
-```
-set default="0"
-set timeout="0"
-
-menuentry "shredos" {
-	linux /boot/shredos console=tty3 loglevel=3 telnetd=enable
-}
-```
-		
-Assuming the headless systems are configured to boot via USB and if UEFI that secure boot is disabled, just plug a USB stick containing ShredOS v2021.08.2_20_0.32.014 or higher into the system. Power cycle the system and then after giving ShredOS sufficient time to boot (4 to 60 seconds depending on the hardware) you can then, from another PC/laptop on the same network, use nmap as shown below to list all IP addresses that have open telnet ports on your local LAN:
-
-```
-nmap -p23 192.168.1.0/24 --open
-$ nmap -p23 192.168.1.0/24 --open
-Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-11-29 20:54 GMT

-Host is up (0.071s latency).

-Host is up (0.050s latency).
-
-PORT   STATE SERVICE
-23/tcp open  telnet
-
-Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (19 hosts up) scanned in 14.53 seconds
-		
-```
-
-Telnet into the appropriate IP address `telnet 192.168.1.100`. Shredos will respond with:
-
-```
-telnet 192.168.1.100
-Trying 192.168.1.100...
-Connected to 192.168.1.100.
-Escape character is '^]'.
-
-shredos login: root
-		{ no password }
-
-sh-5.1# nwipe
-```
-Type `nwipe` as shown above and the nwipe GUI will be displayed and you can proceed with wiping the discs. On some terminals, i.e retro, nwipe doesn't display properly. If you find this then use a different terminal to launch nwipe. Terminals that do work ok are KDE's Konsole, terminator, guake, tmux, xfce terminal and xterm. Terminals that don't seem to work properly via a telnet session with nwipe are cool retro term and qterminal. Putty works but doesn't have the correct box characters but is usable. Putty may work perfectly if you can set the correct character encoding. These are my observations using KDE Neon, they may differ on your systems. If you find a workaround for those terminals that don't display nwipe perfectly over telnet, then please let me know. 
-		
-**WARNING:** Due to the insecure nature of telnet as opposed to ssh, it goes without saying that this method of accessing shredos & nwipe should only be carried out on a trusted local area network and never over the internet unless via a VPN or SSH tunnel. ssh access may be provided at a future date if it's requested.

-[[adding-board-support]]
-== Adding support for a particular board
-
-Buildroot contains basic configurations for several publicly available
-hardware boards, so that users of such a board can easily build a system
-that is known to work. You are welcome to add support for other boards
-to Buildroot too.
-
-To do so, you need to create a normal Buildroot configuration that
-builds a basic system for the hardware: (internal) toolchain, kernel,
-bootloader, filesystem and a simple BusyBox-only userspace. No specific
-package should be selected: the configuration should be as minimal as
-possible, and should only build a working basic BusyBox system for the
-target platform. You can of course use more complicated configurations
-for your internal projects, but the Buildroot project will only
-integrate basic board configurations. This is because package
-selections are highly application-specific.
-
-Once you have a known working configuration, run +make
-savedefconfig+. This will generate a minimal +defconfig+ file at the
-root of the Buildroot source tree. Move this file into the +configs/+
-directory, and rename it +<boardname>_defconfig+. If the configuration
-is a bit more complicated, it is nice to manually reformat it and
-separate it into sections, with a comment before each section. Typical
-sections are _Architecture_, _Toolchain options_ (typically just linux
-headers version), _Firmware_, _Bootloader_, _Kernel_, and _Filesystem_.
-
-Always use fixed versions or commit hashes for the different
-components, not the "latest" version. For example, set
-+BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_VERSION=y+ and
-+BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_VERSION_VALUE+ to the kernel version you tested
-with.
-
-It is recommended to use as much as possible upstream versions of the
-Linux kernel and bootloaders, and to use as much as possible default
-kernel and bootloader configurations. If they are incorrect for your
-board, or no default exists, we encourage you to send fixes to the
-corresponding upstream projects.
-
-However, in the mean time, you may want to store kernel or bootloader
-configuration or patches specific to your target platform. To do so,
-create a directory +board/<manufacturer>+ and a subdirectory
-+board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>+. You can then store your patches
-and configurations in these directories, and reference them from the main
-Buildroot configuration. Refer to xref:customize[] for more details.

-=== Infrastructure for asciidoc documents
-
-[[asciidoc-documents-tutorial]]
-
-The Buildroot manual, which you are currently reading, is entirely written
-using the http://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] mark-up syntax. The manual is then
-rendered to many formats:
-
-* html
-* split-html
-* pdf
-* epub
-* text
-
-Although Buildroot only contains one document written in AsciiDoc, there
-is, as for packages, an infrastructure for rendering documents using the
-AsciiDoc syntax.
-
-Also as for packages, the AsciiDoc infrastructure is available from a
-xref:outside-br-custom[br2-external tree]. This allows documentation for
-a br2-external tree to match the Buildroot documentation, as it will be
-rendered to the same formats and use the same layout and theme.
-
-==== +asciidoc-document+ tutorial
-
-Whereas package infrastructures are suffixed with +-package+, the document
-infrastructures are suffixed with +-document+. So, the AsciiDoc infrastructure
-is named +asciidoc-document+.
-
-Here is an example to render a simple AsciiDoc document.
-
-----
-01: ################################################################################
-02: #
-03: # foo-document
-04: #
-05: ################################################################################
-06:
-07: FOO_SOURCES = $(sort $(wildcard $(pkgdir)/*))
-08: $(eval $(call asciidoc-document))
-----
-
-On line 7, the Makefile declares what the sources of the document are.
-Currently, it is expected that the document's sources are only local;
-Buildroot will not attempt to download anything to render a document.
-Thus, you must indicate where the sources are. Usually, the string
-above is sufficient for a document with no sub-directory structure.
-
-On line 8, we call the +asciidoc-document+ function, which generates all
-the Makefile code necessary to render the document.
-
-==== +asciidoc-document+ reference
-
-The list of variables that can be set in a +.mk+ file to give metadata
-information is (assuming the document name is +foo+) :
-
-* +FOO_SOURCES+, mandatory, defines the source files for the document.
-
-* +FOO_RESOURCES+, optional, may contain a space-separated list of paths
-  to one or more directories containing so-called resources (like CSS or
-  images). By default, empty.
-
-* +FOO_DEPENDENCIES+, optional, the list of packages (most probably,
-  host-packages) that must be built before building this document.
-
-There are also additional hooks (see xref:hooks[] for general information
-on hooks), that a document may set to define extra actions to be done at
-various steps:
-
-* +FOO_POST_RSYNC_HOOKS+ to run additional commands after the sources
-  have been copied by Buildroot. This can for example be used to
-  generate part of the manual with information extracted from the
-  tree. As an example, Buildroot uses this hook to generate the tables
-  in the appendices.
-
-* +FOO_CHECK_DEPENDENCIES_HOOKS+ to run additional tests on required
-  components to generate the document. In AsciiDoc, it is possible to
-  call filters, that is, programs that will parse an AsciiDoc block and
-  render it appropriately (e.g. http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/[ditaa] or
-  https://pythonhosted.org/aafigure/[aafigure]).
-
-* +FOO_CHECK_DEPENDENCIES_<FMT>_HOOKS+, to run additional tests for
-  the specified format +<FMT>+ (see the list of rendered formats, above).
-
-Here is a complete example that uses all variables and all hooks:

-=== Infrastructure for autotools-based packages
-
-[[autotools-package-tutorial]]
-
-==== +autotools-package+ tutorial
-
-First, let's see how to write a +.mk+ file for an autotools-based
-package, with an example :
-
-------------------------
-01: ################################################################################
-02: #
-03: # libfoo
-04: #
-05: ################################################################################
-06:
-07: LIBFOO_VERSION = 1.0
-08: LIBFOO_SOURCE = libfoo-$(LIBFOO_VERSION).tar.gz
-09: LIBFOO_SITE = http://www.foosoftware.org/download
-10: LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING = YES
-11: LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET = NO
-12: LIBFOO_CONF_OPTS = --disable-shared
-13: LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES = libglib2 host-pkgconf
-14:
-15: $(eval $(autotools-package))
-------------------------
-
-On line 7, we declare the version of the package.
-
-On line 8 and 9, we declare the name of the tarball (xz-ed tarball recommended)
-and the location of the tarball on the Web. Buildroot will automatically
-download the tarball from this location.
-
-On line 10, we tell Buildroot to install the package to the staging
-directory. The staging directory, located in +output/staging/+
-is the directory where all the packages are installed, including their
-development files, etc. By default, packages are not installed to the
-staging directory, since usually, only libraries need to be installed in
-the staging directory: their development files are needed to compile
-other libraries or applications depending on them. Also by default, when
-staging installation is enabled, packages are installed in this location
-using the +make install+ command.
-
-On line 11, we tell Buildroot to not install the package to the
-target directory. This directory contains what will become the root
-filesystem running on the target. For purely static libraries, it is
-not necessary to install them in the target directory because they will
-not be used at runtime. By default, target installation is enabled; setting
-this variable to NO is almost never needed. Also by default, packages are
-installed in this location using the +make install+ command.
-
-On line 12, we tell Buildroot to pass a custom configure option, that
-will be passed to the +./configure+ script before configuring
-and building the package.
-
-On line 13, we declare our dependencies, so that they are built
-before the build process of our package starts.
-
-Finally, on line line 15, we invoke the +autotools-package+
-macro that generates all the Makefile rules that actually allows the
-package to be built.
-
-[[autotools-package-reference]]
-
-==== +autotools-package+ reference
-
-The main macro of the autotools package infrastructure is
-+autotools-package+. It is similar to the +generic-package+ macro. The ability to
-have target and host packages is also available, with the
-+host-autotools-package+ macro.
-
-Just like the generic infrastructure, the autotools infrastructure
-works by defining a number of variables before calling the
-+autotools-package+ macro.
-
-First, all the package metadata information variables that exist in the
-generic infrastructure also exist in the autotools infrastructure:
-+LIBFOO_VERSION+, +LIBFOO_SOURCE+,
-+LIBFOO_PATCH+, +LIBFOO_SITE+,
-+LIBFOO_SUBDIR+, +LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES+,
-+LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING+, +LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET+.
-
-A few additional variables, specific to the autotools infrastructure,
-can also be defined. Many of them are only useful in very specific
-cases, typical packages will therefore only use a few of them.
-
-* +LIBFOO_SUBDIR+ may contain the name of a subdirectory
-  inside the package that contains the configure script. This is useful,
-  if for example, the main configure script is not at the root of the
-  tree extracted by the tarball. If +HOST_LIBFOO_SUBDIR+ is
-  not specified, it defaults to +LIBFOO_SUBDIR+.
-
-* +LIBFOO_CONF_ENV+, to specify additional environment
-  variables to pass to the configure script. By default, empty.
-
-* +LIBFOO_CONF_OPTS+, to specify additional configure
-  options to pass to the configure script. By default, empty.
-
-* +LIBFOO_MAKE+, to specify an alternate +make+
-  command. This is typically useful when parallel make is enabled in
-  the configuration (using +BR2_JLEVEL+) but that this
-  feature should be disabled for the given package, for one reason or
-  another. By default, set to +$(MAKE)+. If parallel building
-  is not supported by the package, then it should be set to
-  +LIBFOO_MAKE=$(MAKE1)+.
-
-* +LIBFOO_MAKE_ENV+, to specify additional environment
-  variables to pass to make in the build step. These are passed before
-  the +make+ command. By default, empty.
-
-* +LIBFOO_MAKE_OPTS+, to specify additional variables to
-  pass to make in the build step. These are passed after the
-  +make+ command. By default, empty.
-
-* +LIBFOO_AUTORECONF+, tells whether the package should
-  be autoreconfigured or not (i.e. if the configure script and
-  Makefile.in files should be re-generated by re-running autoconf,
-  automake, libtool, etc.). Valid values are +YES+ and
-  +NO+. By default, the value is +NO+
-
-* +LIBFOO_AUTORECONF_ENV+, to specify additional environment
-  variables to pass to the 'autoreconf' program if
-  +LIBFOO_AUTORECONF=YES+. These are passed in the environment of
-  the 'autoreconf' command. By default, empty.
-
-* +LIBFOO_AUTORECONF_OPTS+ to specify additional options
-  passed to the 'autoreconf' program if
-  +LIBFOO_AUTORECONF=YES+. By default, empty.
-
-* +LIBFOO_GETTEXTIZE+, tells whether the package should be
-  gettextized or not (i.e. if the package uses a different gettext
-  version than Buildroot provides, and it is needed to run
-  'gettextize'.) Only valid when +LIBFOO_AUTORECONF=YES+. Valid
-  values are +YES+ and +NO+. The default is +NO+.
-
-* +LIBFOO_GETTEXTIZE_OPTS+, to specify additional options passed to
-  the 'gettextize' program, if +LIBFOO_GETTEXTIZE=YES+. You may
-  use that if, for example, the +.po+ files are not located in the
-  standard place (i.e. in +po/+ at the root of the package.) By
-  default, '-f'.
-
-* +LIBFOO_LIBTOOL_PATCH+ tells whether the Buildroot
-  patch to fix libtool cross-compilation issues should be applied or
-  not. Valid values are +YES+ and +NO+. By
-  default, the value is +YES+
-
-* +LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_OPTS+ contains the make options
-  used to install the package to the staging directory. By default, the
-  value is +DESTDIR=$(STAGING_DIR) install+, which is
-  correct for most autotools packages. It is still possible to override
-  it.
-
-* +LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET_OPTS+ contains the make options
-  used to install the package to the target directory. By default, the
-  value is +DESTDIR=$(TARGET_DIR) install+. The default
-  value is correct for most autotools packages, but it is still possible
-  to override it if needed.
-
-With the autotools infrastructure, all the steps required to build
-and install the packages are already defined, and they generally work
-well for most autotools-based packages. However, when required, it is
-still possible to customize what is done in any particular step:
-
-* By adding a post-operation hook (after extract, patch, configure,
-  build or install). See xref:hooks[] for details.
-
-* By overriding one of the steps. For example, even if the autotools
-  infrastructure is used, if the package +.mk+ file defines its
-  own +LIBFOO_CONFIGURE_CMDS+ variable, it will be used
-  instead of the default autotools one. However, using this method
-  should be restricted to very specific cases. Do not use it in the
-  general case.

-=== Integration of Cargo-based packages
-
-Cargo is the package manager for the Rust programming language. It allows the
-user to build programs or libraries written in Rust, but it also downloads and
-manages their dependencies, to ensure repeatable builds. Cargo packages are
-called "crates".
-
-[[cargo-package-tutorial]]
-
-==== Cargo-based package's +Config.in+ file
-
-The +Config.in+ file of Cargo-based package 'foo' should contain:
-
----------------------------
-01: config BR2_PACKAGE_FOO
-02: 	bool "foo"
-03: 	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_HOST_RUSTC_TARGET_ARCH_SUPPORTS
-04: 	select BR2_PACKAGE_HOST_RUSTC
-05: 	help
-06: 	  This is a comment that explains what foo is.
-07:
-08: 	  http://foosoftware.org/foo/
----------------------------
-
-==== Cargo-based package's +.mk+ file
-
-Buildroot does not (yet) provide a dedicated package infrastructure for
-Cargo-based packages. So, we will explain how to write a +.mk+ file for such a
-package. Let's start with an example:
-
-------------------------------
-01: ################################################################################
-02: #
-03: # foo
-04: #
-05: ################################################################################
-06:
-07: FOO_VERSION = 1.0
-08: FOO_SOURCE = foo-$(FOO_VERSION).tar.gz
-09: FOO_SITE = http://www.foosoftware.org/download
-10: FOO_LICENSE = GPL-3.0+
-11: FOO_LICENSE_FILES = COPYING
-12:
-13: FOO_DEPENDENCIES = host-rustc
-14:
-15: FOO_CARGO_ENV = CARGO_HOME=$(HOST_DIR)/share/cargo
-16:
-17: FOO_BIN_DIR = target/$(RUSTC_TARGET_NAME)/$(FOO_CARGO_MODE)
-18:
-19: FOO_CARGO_OPTS = \
-20: 	$(if $(BR2_ENABLE_DEBUG),,--release) \
-21: 	--target=$(RUSTC_TARGET_NAME) \
-22: 	--manifest-path=$(@D)/Cargo.toml
-23:
-24: define FOO_BUILD_CMDS
-25: 	$(TARGET_MAKE_ENV) $(FOO_CARGO_ENV) \
-26: 		cargo build $(FOO_CARGO_OPTS)
-27: endef
-28:
-29: define FOO_INSTALL_TARGET_CMDS
-30: 	$(INSTALL) -D -m 0755 $(@D)/$(FOO_BIN_DIR)/foo \
-31: 		$(TARGET_DIR)/usr/bin/foo
-32: endef
-33:
-34: $(eval $(generic-package))
---------------------------------
-
-The Makefile starts with the definition of the standard variables for package
-declaration (lines 7 to 11).
-
-As seen in line 34, it is based on the
-xref:generic-package-tutorial[+generic-package+ infrastructure]. So, it defines
-the variables required by this particular infrastructure, where Cargo is
-invoked:
-
-* +FOO_BUILD_CMDS+: Cargo is invoked to perform the build. The options required
-  to configure the cross-compilation of the package are passed via
-  +FOO_CONF_OPTS+.
-
-* +FOO_INSTALL_TARGET_CMDS+: The binary executable generated is installed on
-  the target.
-
-In order to have Cargo available for the build, +FOO_DEPENDENCIES+ needs to
-contain +host-cargo+.
-
-To sum it up, to add a new Cargo-based package, the Makefile example can be
-copied verbatim then edited to replace all occurences of +FOO+ with the
-uppercase name of the new package and update the values of the standard
-variables.
-
-==== About Dependencies Management
-
-A crate can depend on other libraries from crates.io or git repositories, listed
-in its Cargo.toml file. Before starting a build, Cargo usually downloads
-automatically them. This step can also be performed independently, via the
-+cargo fetch+ command.
-
-Cargo maintains a local cache of the registry index and of git checkouts of the
-crates, whose location is given by +$CARGO_HOME+. As seen in the package
-Makefile example at line 15, this environment variable is set to
-+$(HOST_DIR)/share/cargo+.
-
-This dependency download mechanism is not convenient when performing an offline
-build, as Cargo will fail to fetch the dependencies. In that case, it is advised
-to generate a tarball of the dependencies using the +cargo vendor+ and add it to
-+FOO_EXTRA_DOWNLOADS+.

-=== Infrastructure for CMake-based packages
-
-[[cmake-package-tutorial]]
-
-==== +cmake-package+ tutorial
-
-First, let's see how to write a +.mk+ file for a CMake-based package,
-with an example :
-
-------------------------
-01: ################################################################################
-02: #
-03: # libfoo
-04: #
-05: ################################################################################
-06:
-07: LIBFOO_VERSION = 1.0
-08: LIBFOO_SOURCE = libfoo-$(LIBFOO_VERSION).tar.gz
-09: LIBFOO_SITE = http://www.foosoftware.org/download
-10: LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING = YES
-11: LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET = NO
-12: LIBFOO_CONF_OPTS = -DBUILD_DEMOS=ON
-13: LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES = libglib2 host-pkgconf
-14:
-15: $(eval $(cmake-package))
-------------------------
-
-On line 7, we declare the version of the package.
-
-On line 8 and 9, we declare the name of the tarball (xz-ed tarball recommended)
-and the location of the tarball on the Web. Buildroot will automatically
-download the tarball from this location.
-
-On line 10, we tell Buildroot to install the package to the staging
-directory. The staging directory, located in +output/staging/+
-is the directory where all the packages are installed, including their
-development files, etc. By default, packages are not installed to the
-staging directory, since usually, only libraries need to be installed in
-the staging directory: their development files are needed to compile
-other libraries or applications depending on them. Also by default, when
-staging installation is enabled, packages are installed in this location
-using the +make install+ command.
-
-On line 11, we tell Buildroot to not install the package to the
-target directory. This directory contains what will become the root
-filesystem running on the target. For purely static libraries, it is
-not necessary to install them in the target directory because they will
-not be used at runtime. By default, target installation is enabled; setting
-this variable to NO is almost never needed. Also by default, packages are
-installed in this location using the +make install+ command.
-
-On line 12, we tell Buildroot to pass custom options to CMake when it is
-configuring the package.
-
-On line 13, we declare our dependencies, so that they are built
-before the build process of our package starts.
-
-Finally, on line line 15, we invoke the +cmake-package+
-macro that generates all the Makefile rules that actually allows the
-package to be built.
-
-[[cmake-package-reference]]
-
-==== +cmake-package+ reference
-
-The main macro of the CMake package infrastructure is
-+cmake-package+. It is similar to the +generic-package+ macro. The ability to
-have target and host packages is also available, with the
-+host-cmake-package+ macro.
-
-Just like the generic infrastructure, the CMake infrastructure works
-by defining a number of variables before calling the +cmake-package+
-macro.
-
-First, all the package metadata information variables that exist in
-the generic infrastructure also exist in the CMake infrastructure:
-+LIBFOO_VERSION+, +LIBFOO_SOURCE+, +LIBFOO_PATCH+, +LIBFOO_SITE+,
-+LIBFOO_SUBDIR+, +LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES+, +LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING+,
-+LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET+.
-
-A few additional variables, specific to the CMake infrastructure, can
-also be defined. Many of them are only useful in very specific cases,
-typical packages will therefore only use a few of them.
-
-* +LIBFOO_SUBDIR+ may contain the name of a subdirectory inside the
-  package that contains the main CMakeLists.txt file. This is useful,
-  if for example, the main CMakeLists.txt file is not at the root of
-  the tree extracted by the tarball. If +HOST_LIBFOO_SUBDIR+ is not
-  specified, it defaults to +LIBFOO_SUBDIR+.
-
-* +LIBFOO_CONF_ENV+, to specify additional environment variables to
-  pass to CMake. By default, empty.
-
-* +LIBFOO_CONF_OPTS+, to specify additional configure options to pass
-  to CMake. By default, empty. A number of common CMake options are
-  set by the +cmake-package+ infrastructure; so it is normally not
-  necessary to set them in the package's +*.mk+ file unless you want
-  to override them:
-
-** +CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE+ is driven by +BR2_ENABLE_RUNTIME_DEBUG+;
-** +CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX+;
-** +BUILD_SHARED_LIBS+ is driven by +BR2_STATIC_LIBS+;
-** +BUILD_DOC+, +BUILD_DOCS+ are disabled;
-** +BUILD_EXAMPLE+, +BUILD_EXAMPLES+ are disabled;
-** +BUILD_TEST+, +BUILD_TESTS+, +BUILD_TESTING+ are disabled.
-
-* +LIBFOO_SUPPORTS_IN_SOURCE_BUILD = NO+ should be set when the package
-  cannot be built inside the source tree but needs a separate build
-  directory.
-
-* +LIBFOO_MAKE+, to specify an alternate +make+ command. This is
-  typically useful when parallel make is enabled in the configuration
-  (using +BR2_JLEVEL+) but that this feature should be disabled for
-  the given package, for one reason or another. By default, set to
-  +$(MAKE)+. If parallel building is not supported by the package,
-  then it should be set to +LIBFOO_MAKE=$(MAKE1)+.
-
-* +LIBFOO_MAKE_ENV+, to specify additional environment variables to
-  pass to make in the build step. These are passed before the +make+
-  command. By default, empty.
-
-* +LIBFOO_MAKE_OPTS+, to specify additional variables to pass to make
-  in the build step. These are passed after the +make+ command. By
-  default, empty.
-
-* +LIBFOO_INSTALL_OPTS+ contains the make options used to
-  install the package to the host directory. By default, the value
-  is +install+, which is correct for most CMake packages. It is still
-  possible to override it.
-
-* +LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_OPTS+ contains the make options used to
-  install the package to the staging directory. By default, the value
-  is +DESTDIR=$(STAGING_DIR) install/fast+, which is correct for most
-  CMake packages. It is still possible to override it.
-
-* +LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET_OPTS+ contains the make options used to
-  install the package to the target directory. By default, the value
-  is +DESTDIR=$(TARGET_DIR) install/fast+. The default value is correct
-  for most CMake packages, but it is still possible to override it if
-  needed.
-
-With the CMake infrastructure, all the steps required to build and
-install the packages are already defined, and they generally work well
-for most CMake-based packages. However, when required, it is still
-possible to customize what is done in any particular step:
-
-* By adding a post-operation hook (after extract, patch, configure,
-  build or install). See xref:hooks[] for details.
-
-* By overriding one of the steps. For example, even if the CMake
-  infrastructure is used, if the package +.mk+ file defines its own
-  +LIBFOO_CONFIGURE_CMDS+ variable, it will be used instead of the
-  default CMake one. However, using this method should be restricted
-  to very specific cases. Do not use it in the general case.

-=== Conclusion
-
-As you can see, adding a software package to Buildroot is simply a
-matter of writing a Makefile using an existing example and modifying it
-according to the compilation process required by the package.
-
-If you package software that might be useful for other people, don't
-forget to send a patch to the Buildroot mailing list (see
-xref:submitting-patches[])!

-
-=== Package directory
-
-First of all, create a directory under the +package+ directory for
-your software, for example +libfoo+.
-
-Some packages have been grouped by topic in a sub-directory:
-+x11r7+, +qt5+ and +gstreamer+. If your package fits in
-one of these categories, then create your package directory in these.
-New subdirectories are discouraged, however.
-
-=== Config files
-
-For the package to be displayed in the configuration tool, you need to
-create a Config file in your package directory. There are two types:
-+Config.in+ and +Config.in.host+.
-
-==== +Config.in+ file
-
-For packages used on the target, create a file named +Config.in+. This
-file will contain the option descriptions related to our +libfoo+ software
-that will be used and displayed in the configuration tool. It should basically
-contain:
-
----------------------------
-config BR2_PACKAGE_LIBFOO
-	bool "libfoo"
-	help
-	  This is a comment that explains what libfoo is. The help text
-	  should be wrapped.
-
-	  http://foosoftware.org/libfoo/
----------------------------
-
-The +bool+ line, +help+ line and other metadata information about the
-configuration option must be indented with one tab. The help text
-itself should be indented with one tab and two spaces, lines should
-be wrapped to fit 72 columns, where tab counts for 8, so 62 characters
-in the text itself. The help text must mention the upstream URL of the
-project after an empty line.
-
-As a convention specific to Buildroot, the ordering of the attributes
-is as follows:
-
-1. The type of option: +bool+, +string+... with the prompt
-2. If needed, the +default+ value(s)
-3. Any dependencies on the target in +depends on+ form
-4. Any dependencies on the toolchain in +depends on+ form
-5. Any dependencies on other packages in +depends on+ form
-6. Any dependency of the +select+ form
-7. The help keyword and help text.
-
-You can add other sub-options into a +if BR2_PACKAGE_LIBFOO...endif+
-statement to configure particular things in your software. You can look at
-examples in other packages. The syntax of the +Config.in+ file is the same
-as the one for the kernel Kconfig file. The documentation for this syntax is
-available at http://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt[]
-
-Finally you have to add your new +libfoo/Config.in+ to
-+package/Config.in+ (or in a category subdirectory if you decided to
-put your package in one of the existing categories). The files
-included there are 'sorted alphabetically' per category and are 'NOT'
-supposed to contain anything but the 'bare' name of the package.
-
---------------------------
-source "package/libfoo/Config.in"
---------------------------
-
-
-==== +Config.in.host+ file
-
-Some packages also need to be built for the host system. There are two
-options here:
-
-* The host package is only required to satisfy build-time
-  dependencies of one or more target packages. In this case, add
-  +host-foo+ to the target package's +BAR_DEPENDENCIES+ variable. No
-  +Config.in.host+ file should be created.
-
-* The host package should be explicitly selectable by the user from
-  the configuration menu. In this case, create a +Config.in.host+ file
-  for that host package:
-+
----------------------------
-config BR2_PACKAGE_HOST_FOO
-	bool "host foo"
-	help
-	  This is a comment that explains what foo for the host is.
-
-	  http://foosoftware.org/foo/
----------------------------
-+
-The same coding style and options as for the +Config.in+ file are valid.
-+
-Finally you have to add your new +libfoo/Config.in.host+ to
-+package/Config.in.host+. The files included there are 'sorted alphabetically'
-and are 'NOT' supposed to contain anything but the 'bare' name of the package.
-+
---------------------------
-source "package/foo/Config.in.host"
---------------------------
-+
-The host package will then be available from the +Host utilities+ menu.
-
-[[depends-on-vs-select]]
-==== Choosing +depends on+ or +select+
-
-The +Config.in+ file of your package must also ensure that
-dependencies are enabled. Typically, Buildroot uses the following
-rules:
-
-* Use a +select+ type of dependency for dependencies on
-  libraries. These dependencies are generally not obvious and it
-  therefore make sense to have the kconfig system ensure that the
-  dependencies are selected. For example, the _libgtk2_ package uses
-  +select BR2_PACKAGE_LIBGLIB2+ to make sure this library is also
-  enabled.
-  The +select+ keyword expresses the dependency with a backward
-  semantic.
-
-* Use a +depends on+ type of dependency when the user really needs to
-  be aware of the dependency. Typically, Buildroot uses this type of
-  dependency for dependencies on target architecture, MMU support and
-  toolchain options (see xref:dependencies-target-toolchain-options[]),
-  or for dependencies on "big" things, such as the X.org system.
-  The +depends on+ keyword expresses the dependency with a forward
-  semantic.
-
-.Note
-The current problem with the _kconfig_ language is that these two
-dependency semantics are not internally linked. Therefore, it may be
-possible to select a package, whom one of its dependencies/requirement
-is not met.
-
-An example illustrates both the usage of +select+ and +depends on+.
-
---------------------------
-config BR2_PACKAGE_RRDTOOL
-	bool "rrdtool"
-	depends on BR2_USE_WCHAR
-	select BR2_PACKAGE_FREETYPE
-	select BR2_PACKAGE_LIBART
-	select BR2_PACKAGE_LIBPNG
-	select BR2_PACKAGE_ZLIB
-        help
-	  RRDtool is the OpenSource industry standard, high performance
-	  data logging and graphing system for time series data.
-
-	  http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/
-
-comment "rrdtool needs a toolchain w/ wchar"
-	depends on !BR2_USE_WCHAR
---------------------------
-
-
-Note that these two dependency types are only transitive with the
-dependencies of the same kind.
-
-This means, in the following example:
-
---------------------------
-config BR2_PACKAGE_A
-        bool "Package A"
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_B
-        bool "Package B"
-        depends on BR2_PACKAGE_A
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_C
-        bool "Package C"
-        depends on BR2_PACKAGE_B
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_D
-        bool "Package D"
-        select BR2_PACKAGE_B
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_E
-        bool "Package E"
-        select BR2_PACKAGE_D
---------------------------
-
-* Selecting +Package C+ will be visible if +Package B+ has been
-  selected, which in turn is only visible if +Package A+ has been
-  selected.
-
-* Selecting +Package E+ will select +Package D+, which will select
-  +Package B+, it will not check for the dependencies of +Package B+,
-  so it will not select +Package A+.
-
-* Since +Package B+ is selected but +Package A+ is not, this violates
-  the dependency of +Package B+ on +Package A+. Therefore, in such a
-  situation, the transitive dependency has to be added explicitly:
-
---------------------------
-config BR2_PACKAGE_D
-	bool "Package D"
-	select BR2_PACKAGE_B
-	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_A
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_E
-	bool "Package E"
-	select BR2_PACKAGE_D
-	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_A
---------------------------
-
-Overall, for package library dependencies, +select+ should be
-preferred.
-
-Note that such dependencies will ensure that the dependency option
-is also enabled, but not necessarily built before your package. To do
-so, the dependency also needs to be expressed in the +.mk+ file of the
-package.
-
-Further formatting details: see xref:writing-rules-config-in[the
-coding style].
-
-[[dependencies-target-toolchain-options]]
-==== Dependencies on target and toolchain options
-
-Many packages depend on certain options of the toolchain: the choice of
-C library, C++ support, thread support, RPC support, wchar support,
-or dynamic library support. Some packages can only be built on certain
-target architectures, or if an MMU is available in the processor.
-
-These dependencies have to be expressed with the appropriate 'depends
-on' statements in the Config.in file. Additionally, for dependencies on
-toolchain options, a +comment+ should be displayed when the option is
-not enabled, so that the user knows why the package is not available.
-Dependencies on target architecture or MMU support should not be
-made visible in a comment: since it is unlikely that the user can
-freely choose another target, it makes little sense to show these
-dependencies explicitly.
-
-The +comment+ should only be visible if the +config+ option itself would
-be visible when the toolchain option dependencies are met. This means
-that all other dependencies of the package (including dependencies on
-target architecture and MMU support) have to be repeated on the
-+comment+ definition. To keep it clear, the +depends on+ statement for
-these non-toolchain option should be kept separate from the +depends on+
-statement for the toolchain options.
-If there is a dependency on a config option in that same file (typically
-the main package) it is preferable to have a global +if ... endif+
-construct rather than repeating the +depends on+ statement on the
-comment and other config options.
-
-The general format of a dependency +comment+ for package foo is:
-
---------------------------
-foo needs a toolchain w/ featA, featB, featC
---------------------------
-
-for example:
-
---------------------------
-mpd needs a toolchain w/ C++, threads, wchar
---------------------------
-
-or
-
---------------------------
-crda needs a toolchain w/ threads
---------------------------
-
-Note that this text is kept brief on purpose, so that it will fit on a
-80-character terminal.
-
-The rest of this section enumerates the different target and toolchain
-options, the corresponding config symbols to depend on, and the text to
-use in the comment.
-
-* Target architecture
-** Dependency symbol: +BR2_powerpc+, +BR2_mips+, ... (see +arch/Config.in+)
-** Comment string: no comment to be added
-
-* MMU support
-** Dependency symbol: +BR2_USE_MMU+
-** Comment string: no comment to be added
-
-* Gcc +__sync_*+ built-ins used for atomic operations. They are
-  available in variants operating on 1 byte, 2 bytes, 4 bytes and 8
-  bytes. Since different architectures support atomic operations on
-  different sizes, one dependency symbol is available for each size:
-** Dependency symbol: +BR2_TOOLCHAIN_HAS_SYNC_1+ for 1 byte,
-   +BR2_TOOLCHAIN_HAS_SYNC_2+ for 2 bytes,
-   +BR2_TOOLCHAIN_HAS_SYNC_4+ for 4 bytes, +BR2_TOOLCHAIN_HAS_SYNC_8+
-   for 8 bytes.
-** Comment string: no comment to be added
-
-* Gcc +__atomic_*+ built-ins used for atomic operations.
-** Dependency symbol: +BR2_TOOLCHAIN_HAS_ATOMIC+.
-** Comment string: no comment to be added
-
-* Kernel headers
-** Dependency symbol: +BR2_TOOLCHAIN_HEADERS_AT_LEAST_X_Y+, (replace
-   +X_Y+ with the proper version, see +toolchain/Config.in+)
-** Comment string: +headers >= X.Y+ and/or `headers <= X.Y` (replace
-   +X.Y+ with the proper version)
-
-* GCC version
-** Dependency symbol: +BR2_TOOLCHAIN_GCC_AT_LEAST_X_Y+, (replace
-   +X_Y+ with the proper version, see +toolchain/Config.in+)
-** Comment string: +gcc >= X.Y+ and/or `gcc <= X.Y` (replace
-   +X.Y+ with the proper version)
-
-* Host GCC version
-** Dependency symbol: +BR2_HOST_GCC_AT_LEAST_X_Y+, (replace
-   +X_Y+ with the proper version, see +Config.in+)
-** Comment string: no comment to be added
-** Note that it is usually not the package itself that has a minimum
-   host GCC version, but rather a host-package on which it depends.
-
-* C library
-** Dependency symbol: +BR2_TOOLCHAIN_USES_GLIBC+,
-   +BR2_TOOLCHAIN_USES_MUSL+, +BR2_TOOLCHAIN_USES_UCLIBC+
-** Comment string: for the C library, a slightly different comment text
-   is used: +foo needs a glibc toolchain+, or `foo needs a glibc
-   toolchain w/ C++`
-
-* C++ support
-** Dependency symbol: +BR2_INSTALL_LIBSTDCPP+
-** Comment string: `C++`
-
-* D support

-* Fortran support
-** Dependency symbol: +BR2_TOOLCHAIN_HAS_FORTRAN+
-** Comment string: `fortran`
-
-* thread support
-** Dependency symbol: +BR2_TOOLCHAIN_HAS_THREADS+
-** Comment string: +threads+ (unless +BR2_TOOLCHAIN_HAS_THREADS_NPTL+
-   is also needed, in which case, specifying only +NPTL+ is sufficient)
-
-* NPTL thread support
-** Dependency symbol: +BR2_TOOLCHAIN_HAS_THREADS_NPTL+
-** Comment string: +NPTL+
-
-* RPC support

-** Dependency symbol: +BR2_USE_WCHAR+
-** Comment string: +wchar+
-
-* dynamic library
-** Dependency symbol: +!BR2_STATIC_LIBS+
-** Comment string: +dynamic library+
-
-==== Dependencies on a Linux kernel built by buildroot
-
-Some packages need a Linux kernel to be built by buildroot. These are
-typically kernel modules or firmware. A comment should be added in the
-Config.in file to express this dependency, similar to dependencies on
-toolchain options. The general format is:
-
---------------------------
-foo needs a Linux kernel to be built
---------------------------
-
-If there is a dependency on both toolchain options and the Linux
-kernel, use this format:
-
---------------------------
-foo needs a toolchain w/ featA, featB, featC and a Linux kernel to be built
---------------------------
-
-==== Dependencies on udev /dev management
-
-If a package needs udev /dev management, it should depend on symbol
-+BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_UDEV+, and the following comment should be added:
-
---------------------------
-foo needs udev /dev management
---------------------------
-
-If there is a dependency on both toolchain options and udev /dev
-management, use this format:
-
---------------------------
-foo needs udev /dev management and a toolchain w/ featA, featB, featC
---------------------------
-
-==== Dependencies on features provided by virtual packages
-
-Some features can be provided by more than one package, such as the
-openGL libraries.
-
-See xref:virtual-package-tutorial[] for more on the virtual packages.
-
-=== The +.mk+ file
-
-[[adding-packages-mk]]
-
-Finally, here's the hardest part. Create a file named +libfoo.mk+. It
-describes how the package should be downloaded, configured, built,
-installed, etc.
-
-Depending on the package type, the +.mk+ file must be written in a
-different way, using different infrastructures:
-
-* *Makefiles for generic packages* (not using autotools or CMake):
-  These are based on an infrastructure similar to the one used for
-  autotools-based packages, but require a little more work from the
-  developer. They specify what should be done for the configuration,
-  compilation and installation of the package. This
-  infrastructure must be used for all packages that do not use the
-  autotools as their build system. In the future, other specialized
-  infrastructures might be written for other build systems. We cover
-  them through in a xref:generic-package-tutorial[tutorial] and a
-  xref:generic-package-reference[reference].
-
-* *Makefiles for autotools-based software* (autoconf, automake, etc.):
-  We provide a dedicated infrastructure for such packages, since
-  autotools is a very common build system. This infrastructure 'must'
-  be used for new packages that rely on the autotools as their build
-  system. We cover them through a xref:autotools-package-tutorial[tutorial]
-  and xref:autotools-package-reference[reference].
-
-* *Makefiles for cmake-based software*: We provide a dedicated
-   infrastructure for such packages, as CMake is a more and more
-   commonly used build system and has a standardized behaviour. This
-   infrastructure 'must' be used for new packages that rely on
-   CMake. We cover them through a xref:cmake-package-tutorial[tutorial]
-   and xref:cmake-package-reference[reference].
-
-* *Makefiles for Python modules*: We have a dedicated infrastructure
-   for Python modules that use either the +distutils+ or the
-   +setuptools+ mechanism. We cover them through a
-   xref:python-package-tutorial[tutorial] and a
-   xref:python-package-reference[reference].
-
-* *Makefiles for Lua modules*: We have a dedicated infrastructure for
-   Lua modules available through the LuaRocks web site. We cover them
-   through a xref:luarocks-package-tutorial[tutorial] and a
-   xref:luarocks-package-reference[reference].
-
-Further formatting details: see xref:writing-rules-mk[the writing
-rules].
-
-[[adding-packages-hash]]
-=== The +.hash+ file
-
-When possible, you must add a third file, named +libfoo.hash+, that
-contains the hashes of the downloaded files for the +libfoo+
-package. The only reason for not adding a +.hash+ file is when hash
-checking is not possible due to how the package is downloaded.
-
-When a package has a version selection choice, then the hash file may be
-stored in a subdirectory named after the version, e.g.
-+package/libfoo/1.2.3/libfoo.hash+. This is especially important if the
-different versions have different licensing terms, but they are stored
-in the same file. Otherwise, the hash file should stay in the package's
-directory.
-
-The hashes stored in that file are used to validate the integrity of the
-downloaded files and of the license files.
-
-The format of this file is one line for each file for which to check the
-hash, each line with the following three fields separated by two spaces:
-
-* the type of hash, one of:
-** +md5+, +sha1+, +sha224+, +sha256+, +sha384+, +sha512+, +none+
-* the hash of the file:
-** for +none+, one or more non-space chars, usually just the string +xxx+

-There can be more than one hash for a single file, each on its own line. In
-this case, all hashes must match.
-
-.Note
-Ideally, the hashes stored in this file should match the hashes published by
-upstream, e.g. on their website, in the e-mail announcement... If upstream
-provides more than one type of hash (e.g. +sha1+ and +sha512+), then it is
-best to add all those hashes in the +.hash+ file. If upstream does not
-provide any hash, or only provides an +md5+ hash, then compute at least one
-strong hash yourself (preferably +sha256+, but not +md5+), and mention
-this in a comment line above the hashes.
-
-.Note
-The hashes for license files are used to detect a license change when a
-package version is bumped. The hashes are checked during the make legal-info
-target run. For a package with multiple versions (like Qt5),
-create the hash file in a subdirectory +<packageversion>+ of that package
-(see also xref:patch-apply-order[]).
-
-The +none+ hash type is reserved to those archives downloaded from a
-repository, like a 'git clone', a 'subversion checkout'...
-
-The example below defines a +sha1+ and a +sha256+ published by upstream for
-the main +libfoo-1.2.3.tar.bz2+ tarball, an +md5+ from upstream and a
-locally-computed +sha256+ hashes for a binary blob, a +sha256+ for a
-downloaded patch, and an archive with no hash:

-
-If the +.hash+ file is present, and it contains one or more hashes for a
-downloaded file, the hash(es) computed by Buildroot (after download) must
-match the hash(es) stored in the +.hash+ file. If one or more hashes do
-not match, Buildroot considers this an error, deletes the downloaded file,
-and aborts.
-
-If the +.hash+ file is present, but it does not contain a hash for a
-downloaded file, Buildroot considers this an error and aborts. However,
-the downloaded file is left in the download directory since this
-typically indicates that the +.hash+ file is wrong but the downloaded
-file is probably OK.
-
-Hashes are currently checked for files fetched from http/ftp servers,
-Git repositories, files copied using scp and local files. Hashes are
-not checked for other version control systems (such as Subversion,
-CVS, etc.) because Buildroot currently does not generate reproducible
-tarballs when source code is fetched from such version control
-systems.
-
-Hashes should only be added in +.hash+ files for files that are
-guaranteed to be stable. For example, patches auto-generated by Github
-are not guaranteed to be stable, and therefore their hashes can change
-over time. Such patches should not be downloaded, and instead be added
-locally to the package folder.
-
-If the +.hash+ file is missing, then no check is done at all.

---------------------------------
-
-The Makefile begins on line 7 to 11 with metadata information: the
-version of the package (+LIBFOO_VERSION+), the name of the
-tarball containing the package (+LIBFOO_SOURCE+) (xz-ed tarball recommended)
-the Internet location at which the tarball can be downloaded from
-(+LIBFOO_SITE+), the license (+LIBFOO_LICENSE+) and file with the
-license text (+LIBFOO_LICENSE_FILES+). All variables must start with
-the same prefix, +LIBFOO_+ in this case. This prefix is always the
-uppercased version of the package name (see below to understand where
-the package name is defined).
-
-On line 12, we specify that this package wants to install something to
-the staging space. This is often needed for libraries, since they must
-install header files and other development files in the staging space.
-This will ensure that the commands listed in the
-+LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS+ variable will be executed.
-
-On line 13, we specify that there is some fixing to be done to some
-of the 'libfoo-config' files that were installed during
-+LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS+ phase.
-These *-config files are executable shell script files that are
-located in '$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/bin' directory and are executed
-by other 3rd party packages to find out the location and the linking
-flags of this particular package.
-
-The problem is that all these *-config files by default give wrong,
-host system linking flags that are unsuitable for cross-compiling.
-
-For example:	'-I/usr/include' instead of '-I$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/include'
-or:		'-L/usr/lib' instead of '-L$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/lib'
-
-So some sed magic is done to these scripts to make them give correct
-flags.
-The argument to be given to +LIBFOO_CONFIG_SCRIPTS+ is the file name(s)
-of the shell script(s) needing fixing. All these names are relative to
-'$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/bin' and if needed multiple names can be given.
-
-In addition, the scripts listed in +LIBFOO_CONFIG_SCRIPTS+ are removed
-from +$(TARGET_DIR)/usr/bin+, since they are not needed on the target.
-
-.Config script: 'divine' package
-================================
-Package divine installs shell script '$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/bin/divine-config'.
-
-So its fixup would be:
-
---------------------------------
-DIVINE_CONFIG_SCRIPTS = divine-config
---------------------------------
-================================
-
-.Config script: 'imagemagick' package:
-================================
-Package imagemagick installs the following scripts:
-'$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/bin/{Magick,Magick++,MagickCore,MagickWand,Wand}-config'
-
-So it's fixup would be:
-
---------------------------------
-IMAGEMAGICK_CONFIG_SCRIPTS = \
-   Magick-config Magick++-config \
-   MagickCore-config MagickWand-config Wand-config
---------------------------------
-================================
-
-On line 14, we specify the list of dependencies this package relies
-on. These dependencies are listed in terms of lower-case package names,
-which can be packages for the target (without the +host-+
-prefix) or packages for the host (with the +host-+) prefix).
-Buildroot will ensure that all these packages are built and installed
-'before' the current package starts its configuration.
-
-The rest of the Makefile, lines 16..29, defines what should be done
-at the different steps of the package configuration, compilation and
-installation.
-+LIBFOO_BUILD_CMDS+ tells what steps should be performed to
-build the package. +LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS+ tells what
-steps should be performed to install the package in the staging space.
-+LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET_CMDS+ tells what steps should be
-performed to install the package in the target space.
-
-All these steps rely on the +$(@D)+ variable, which
-contains the directory where the source code of the package has been
-extracted.
-
-On lines 31..33, we define a user that is used by this package (e.g.
-to run a daemon as non-root) (+LIBFOO_USERS+).
-
-On line 35..37, we define a device-node file used by this package
-(+LIBFOO_DEVICES+).
-
-On line 39..41, we define the permissions to set to specific files
-installed by this package (+LIBFOO_PERMISSIONS+).
-
-Finally, on line 43, we call the +generic-package+ function, which
-generates, according to the variables defined previously, all the
-Makefile code necessary to make your package working.
-
-[[generic-package-reference]]
-
-==== +generic-package+ reference
-
-There are two variants of the generic target. The +generic-package+ macro is
-used for packages to be cross-compiled for the target. The
-+host-generic-package+ macro is used for host packages, natively compiled
-for the host. It is possible to call both of them in a single +.mk+
-file: once to create the rules to generate a target
-package and once to create the rules to generate a host package:
-
-----------------------
-$(eval $(generic-package))
-$(eval $(host-generic-package))
-----------------------
-
-This might be useful if the compilation of the target package requires
-some tools to be installed on the host. If the package name is
-+libfoo+, then the name of the package for the target is also
-+libfoo+, while the name of the package for the host is
-+host-libfoo+. These names should be used in the DEPENDENCIES
-variables of other packages, if they depend on +libfoo+ or
-+host-libfoo+.
-
-The call to the +generic-package+ and/or +host-generic-package+ macro
-*must* be at the end of the +.mk+ file, after all variable definitions.
-The call to +host-generic-package+ *must* be after the call to
-+generic-package+, if any.
-
-For the target package, the +generic-package+ uses the variables defined by
-the .mk file and prefixed by the uppercased package name:
-+LIBFOO_*+. +host-generic-package+ uses the +HOST_LIBFOO_*+ variables. For
-'some' variables, if the +HOST_LIBFOO_+ prefixed variable doesn't
-exist, the package infrastructure uses the corresponding variable
-prefixed by +LIBFOO_+. This is done for variables that are likely to
-have the same value for both the target and host packages. See below
-for details.
-
-The list of variables that can be set in a +.mk+ file to give metadata
-information is (assuming the package name is +libfoo+) :
-
-* +LIBFOO_VERSION+, mandatory, must contain the version of the
-  package. Note that if +HOST_LIBFOO_VERSION+ doesn't exist, it is
-  assumed to be the same as +LIBFOO_VERSION+. It can also be a
-  revision number or a tag for packages that are fetched directly
-  from their version control system. Examples:
-  ** a version for a release tarball: +LIBFOO_VERSION = 0.1.2+
-  ** a sha1 for a git tree: +LIBFOO_VERSION = cb9d6aa9429e838f0e54faa3d455bcbab5eef057+
-  ** a tag for a git tree +LIBFOO_VERSION = v0.1.2+
-+
-.Note:
-Using a branch name as +FOO_VERSION+ is not supported, because it does
-not and can not work as people would expect it should:
-+
-  1. due to local caching, Buildroot will not re-fetch the repository,
-     so people who expect to be able to follow the remote repository
-     would be quite surprised and disappointed;
-  2. because two builds can never be perfectly simultaneous, and because
-     the remote repository may get new commits on the branch anytime,
-     two users, using the same Buildroot tree and building the same
-     configuration, may get different source, thus rendering the build
-     non reproducible, and people would be quite surprised and
-     disappointed.
-
-* +LIBFOO_SOURCE+ may contain the name of the tarball of the package,
-  which Buildroot will use to download the tarball from
-  +LIBFOO_SITE+. If +HOST_LIBFOO_SOURCE+ is not specified, it defaults
-  to +LIBFOO_SOURCE+. If none are specified, then the value is assumed
-  to be +libfoo-$(LIBFOO_VERSION).tar.gz+. +
-  Example: +LIBFOO_SOURCE = foobar-$(LIBFOO_VERSION).tar.bz2+
-
-* +LIBFOO_PATCH+ may contain a space-separated list of patch file
-  names, that Buildroot will download and apply to the package source
-  code. If an entry contains +://+, then Buildroot will assume it is a
-  full URL and download the patch from this location. Otherwise,
-  Buildroot will assume that the patch should be downloaded from
-  +LIBFOO_SITE+. If +HOST_LIBFOO_PATCH+ is not specified, it defaults
-  to +LIBFOO_PATCH+. Note that patches that are included in Buildroot
-  itself use a different mechanism: all files of the form
-  +*.patch+ present in the package directory inside
-  Buildroot will be applied to the package after extraction (see
-  xref:patch-policy[patching a package]). Finally, patches listed in
-  the +LIBFOO_PATCH+ variable are applied _before_ the patches stored
-  in the Buildroot package directory.
-
-* +LIBFOO_SITE+ provides the location of the package, which can be a
-  URL or a local filesystem path. HTTP, FTP and SCP are supported URL
-  types for retrieving package tarballs. In these cases don't include a
-  trailing slash: it will be added by Buildroot between the directory
-  and the filename as appropriate. Git, Subversion, Mercurial,
-  and Bazaar are supported URL types for retrieving packages directly
-  from source code management systems. There is a helper function to make
-  it easier to download source tarballs from GitHub (refer to
-  xref:github-download-url[] for details). A filesystem path may be used
-  to specify either a tarball or a directory containing the package
-  source code. See +LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD+ below for more details on how
-  retrieval works. +
-  Note that SCP URLs should be of the form
-  +scp://[user@]host:filepath+, and that filepath is relative to the
-  user's home directory, so you may want to prepend the path with a
-  slash for absolute paths:
-  +scp://[user@]host:/absolutepath+. +
-  If +HOST_LIBFOO_SITE+ is not specified, it defaults to
-  +LIBFOO_SITE+.
-  Examples: +
-    +LIBFOO_SITE=http://www.libfoosoftware.org/libfoo+ +
-    +LIBFOO_SITE=http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/Tremor+ +
-    +LIBFOO_SITE=/opt/software/libfoo.tar.gz+ +
-    +LIBFOO_SITE=$(TOPDIR)/../src/libfoo+
-
-* +LIBFOO_DL_OPTS+ is a space-separated list of additional options to
-  pass to the downloader. Useful for retrieving documents with
-  server-side checking for user logins and passwords, or to use a proxy.
-  All download methods valid for +LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD+ are supported;
-  valid options depend on the download method (consult the man page
-  for the respective download utilities).
-
-* +LIBFOO_EXTRA_DOWNLOADS+ is a space-separated list of additional
-  files that Buildroot should download. If an entry contains +://+
-  then Buildroot will assume it is a complete URL and will download
-  the file using this URL. Otherwise, Buildroot will assume the file
-  to be downloaded is located at +LIBFOO_SITE+. Buildroot will not do
-  anything with those additional files, except download them: it will
-  be up to the package recipe to use them from +$(LIBFOO_DL_DIR)+.
-
-* +LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD+ determines the method used to fetch or copy the
-  package source code. In many cases, Buildroot guesses the method
-  from the contents of +LIBFOO_SITE+ and setting +LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD+
-  is unnecessary. When +HOST_LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD+ is not specified, it
-  defaults to the value of +LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD+. +
-  The possible values of +LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD+ are:
-  ** +wget+ for normal FTP/HTTP downloads of tarballs. Used by
-     default when +LIBFOO_SITE+ begins with +http://+, +https://+ or
-     +ftp://+.
-  ** +scp+ for downloads of tarballs over SSH with scp. Used by
-     default when +LIBFOO_SITE+ begins with +scp://+.
-  ** +svn+ for retrieving source code from a Subversion repository.
-     Used by default when +LIBFOO_SITE+ begins with +svn://+. When a
-     +http://+ Subversion repository URL is specified in
-     +LIBFOO_SITE+, one 'must' specify +LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD=svn+.
-     Buildroot performs a checkout which is preserved as a tarball in
-     the download cache; subsequent builds use the tarball instead of
-     performing another checkout.
-  ** +cvs+ for retrieving source code from a CVS repository.
-     Used by default when +LIBFOO_SITE+ begins with +cvs://+.
-     The downloaded source code is cached as with the +svn+ method.
-     Anonymous pserver mode is assumed otherwise explicitly defined
-     on +LIBFOO_SITE+. Both
-     +LIBFOO_SITE=cvs://libfoo.net:/cvsroot/libfoo+ and
-     +LIBFOO_SITE=cvs://:ext:libfoo.net:/cvsroot/libfoo+
-     are accepted, on the former anonymous pserver access mode is
-     assumed.
-     +LIBFOO_SITE+ 'must' contain the source URL as well as the remote
-     repository directory. The module is the package name.
-     +LIBFOO_VERSION+ is 'mandatory' and 'must' be a tag, a branch, or
-     a date (e.g. "2014-10-20", "2014-10-20 13:45", "2014-10-20
-     13:45+01" see "man cvs" for further details).
-  ** +git+ for retrieving source code from a Git repository. Used by
-     default when +LIBFOO_SITE+ begins with +git://+. The downloaded
-     source code is cached as with the +svn+
-     method.
-  ** +hg+ for retrieving source code from a Mercurial repository. One
-     'must' specify +LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD=hg+ when +LIBFOO_SITE+
-     contains a Mercurial repository URL. The downloaded source code
-     is cached as with the +svn+ method.
-  ** +bzr+ for retrieving source code from a Bazaar repository. Used
-     by default when +LIBFOO_SITE+ begins with +bzr://+. The
-     downloaded source code is cached as with the +svn+ method.
-  ** +file+ for a local tarball. One should use this when
-     +LIBFOO_SITE+ specifies a package tarball as a local filename.
-     Useful for software that isn't available publicly or in version
-     control.
-  ** +local+ for a local source code directory. One should use this
-     when +LIBFOO_SITE+ specifies a local directory path containing
-     the package source code. Buildroot copies the contents of the
-     source directory into the package's build directory. Note that
-     for +local+ packages, no patches are applied. If you need to
-     still patch the source code, use +LIBFOO_POST_RSYNC_HOOKS+, see
-     xref:hooks-rsync[].
-
-* +LIBFOO_GIT_SUBMODULES+ can be set to +YES+ to create an archive
-  with the git submodules in the repository.  This is only available
-  for packages downloaded with git (i.e. when
-  +LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD=git+).  Note that we try not to use such git
-  submodules when they contain bundled libraries, in which case we
-  prefer to use those libraries from their own package.
-
-* +LIBFOO_STRIP_COMPONENTS+ is the number of leading components
-  (directories) that tar must strip from file names on extraction.
-  The tarball for most packages has one leading component named
-  "<pkg-name>-<pkg-version>", thus Buildroot passes
-  --strip-components=1 to tar to remove it.
-  For non-standard packages that don't have this component, or
-  that have more than one leading component to strip, set this
-  variable with the value to be passed to tar. Default: 1.
-
-* +LIBFOO_EXCLUDES+ is a space-separated list of patterns to exclude
-  when extracting the archive. Each item from that list is passed as
-  a tar's +--exclude+ option. By default, empty.
-
-* +LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES+ lists the dependencies (in terms of package
-  name) that are required for the current target package to
-  compile. These dependencies are guaranteed to be compiled and
-  installed before the configuration of the current package starts.
-  However, modifications to configuration of these dependencies will
-  not force a rebuild of the current package. In a similar way,
-  +HOST_LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES+ lists the dependencies for the current
-  host package.
-
-* +LIBFOO_EXTRACT_DEPENDENCIES+ lists the dependencies (in terms of
-  package name) that are required for the current target package to be
-  extracted. These dependencies are guaranteed to be compiled and
-  installed before the extract step of the current package
-  starts. This is only used internally by the package infrastructure,
-  and should typically not be used directly by packages.
-
-* +LIBFOO_PATCH_DEPENDENCIES+ lists the dependencies (in terms of
-  package name) that are required for the current package to be
-  patched. These dependencies are guaranteed to be extracted and
-  patched (but not necessarily built) before the current package is
-  patched. In a similar way, +HOST_LIBFOO_PATCH_DEPENDENCIES+ lists
-  the dependencies for the current host package.
-  This is seldom used; usually, +LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES+ is what you
-  really want to use.
-
-* +LIBFOO_PROVIDES+ lists all the virtual packages +libfoo+ is an
-  implementation of. See xref:virtual-package-tutorial[].
-
-* +LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING+ can be set to +YES+ or +NO+ (default). If
-  set to +YES+, then the commands in the +LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS+
-  variables are executed to install the package into the staging
-  directory.
-
-* +LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET+ can be set to +YES+ (default) or +NO+. If
-  set to +YES+, then the commands in the +LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET_CMDS+
-  variables are executed to install the package into the target
-  directory.
-
-* +LIBFOO_INSTALL_IMAGES+ can be set to +YES+ or +NO+ (default). If
-  set to +YES+, then the commands in the +LIBFOO_INSTALL_IMAGES_CMDS+
-  variable are executed to install the package into the images
-  directory.
-
-* +LIBFOO_CONFIG_SCRIPTS+ lists the names of the files in
-  '$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/bin' that need some special fixing to make them
-  cross-compiling friendly. Multiple file names separated by space can
-  be given and all are relative to '$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/bin'. The files
-  listed in +LIBFOO_CONFIG_SCRIPTS+ are also removed from
-  +$(TARGET_DIR)/usr/bin+ since they are not needed on the target.
-
-* +LIBFOO_DEVICES+ lists the device files to be created by Buildroot
-  when using the static device table. The syntax to use is the
-  makedevs one. You can find some documentation for this syntax in the
-  xref:makedev-syntax[]. This variable is optional.
-
-* +LIBFOO_PERMISSIONS+ lists the changes of permissions to be done at
-  the end of the build process. The syntax is once again the makedevs one.
-  You can find some documentation for this syntax in the xref:makedev-syntax[].
-  This variable is optional.
-
-* +LIBFOO_USERS+ lists the users to create for this package, if it installs
-  a program you want to run as a specific user (e.g. as a daemon, or as a
-  cron-job). The syntax is similar in spirit to the makedevs one, and is
-  described in the xref:makeuser-syntax[]. This variable is optional.
-
-* +LIBFOO_LICENSE+ defines the license (or licenses) under which the package
-  is released.
-  This name will appear in the manifest file produced by +make legal-info+.
-  If the license appears in https://spdx.org/licenses/[the SPDX License List],
-  use the SPDX short identifier to make the manifest file uniform.
-  Otherwise, describe the license in a precise and concise way, avoiding
-  ambiguous names such as +BSD+ which actually name a family of licenses.
-  This variable is optional. If it is not defined, +unknown+ will appear in
-  the +license+ field of the manifest file for this package. +
-  The expected format for this variable must comply with the following rules:
-  ** If different parts of the package are released under different
-     licenses, then +comma+ separate licenses (e.g. +`LIBFOO_LICENSE =
-     GPL-2.0+, LGPL-2.1+`+). If there is clear distinction between which
-     component is licensed under what license, then annotate the license
-     with that component, between parenthesis (e.g. +`LIBFOO_LICENSE =
-     GPL-2.0+ (programs), LGPL-2.1+ (libraries)`+).
-  ** If some licenses are conditioned on a sub-option being enabled, append
-     the conditional licenses with a comma (e.g.: `FOO_LICENSE += , GPL-2.0+
-     (programs)`); the infrastructure will internally remove the space before
-     the comma.
-  ** If the package is dual licensed, then separate licenses with the
-     +or+ keyword (e.g. +`LIBFOO_LICENSE = AFL-2.1 or GPL-2.0+`+).
-
-* +LIBFOO_LICENSE_FILES+ is a space-separated list of files in the package
-  tarball that contain the license(s) under which the package is released.
-  +make legal-info+ copies all of these files in the +legal-info+ directory.
-  See xref:legal-info[] for more information.
-  This variable is optional. If it is not defined, a warning will be produced
-  to let you know, and +not saved+ will appear in the +license files+ field
-  of the manifest file for this package.
-
-* +LIBFOO_ACTUAL_SOURCE_TARBALL+ only applies to packages whose
-  +LIBFOO_SITE+ / +LIBFOO_SOURCE+ pair points to an archive that does
-  not actually contain source code, but binary code. This a very
-  uncommon case, only known to apply to external toolchains which come
-  already compiled, although theoretically it might apply to other
-  packages. In such cases a separate tarball is usually available with
-  the actual source code. Set +LIBFOO_ACTUAL_SOURCE_TARBALL+ to the
-  name of the actual source code archive and Buildroot will download
-  it and use it when you run +make legal-info+ to collect
-  legally-relevant material.  Note this file will not be downloaded
-  during regular builds nor by +make source+.
-
-* +LIBFOO_ACTUAL_SOURCE_SITE+ provides the location of the actual
-  source tarball. The default value is +LIBFOO_SITE+, so you don't
-  need to set this variable if the binary and source archives are
-  hosted on the same directory.  If +LIBFOO_ACTUAL_SOURCE_TARBALL+ is
-  not set, it doesn't make sense to define
-  +LIBFOO_ACTUAL_SOURCE_SITE+.
-
-* +LIBFOO_REDISTRIBUTE+ can be set to +YES+ (default) or +NO+ to indicate if
-  the package source code is allowed to be redistributed. Set it to +NO+ for
-  non-opensource packages: Buildroot will not save the source code for this
-  package when collecting the +legal-info+.
-
-* +LIBFOO_FLAT_STACKSIZE+ defines the stack size of an application built into
-  the FLAT binary format. The application stack size on the NOMMU architecture
-  processors can't be enlarged at run time. The default stack size for the
-  FLAT binary format is only 4k bytes. If the application consumes more stack,
-  append the required number here.
-
-* +LIBFOO_BIN_ARCH_EXCLUDE+ is a space-separated list of paths (relative
-  to the target directory) to ignore when checking that the package
-  installs correctly cross-compiled binaries. You seldom need to set this
-  variable, unless the package installs binary blobs outside the default
-  locations, `/lib/firmware`, `/usr/lib/firmware`, `/lib/modules`,
-  `/usr/lib/modules`, and `/usr/share`, which are automatically excluded.
-
-* +LIBFOO_IGNORE_CVES+ is a space-separated list of CVEs that tells
-  Buildroot CVE tracking tools which CVEs should be ignored for this
-  package. This is typically used when the CVE is fixed by a patch in
-  the package, or when the CVE for some reason does not affect the
-  Buildroot package. A Makefile comment must always precede the
-  addition of a CVE to this variable. Example:
-
-----------------------
-# 0001-fix-cve-2020-12345.patch
-LIBFOO_IGNORE_CVES += CVE-2020-12345
-# only when built with libbaz, which Buildroot doesn't support
-LIBFOO_IGNORE_CVES += CVE-2020-54321
-----------------------
-
-* +LIBFOO_CPE_ID_*+ variables is a set of variables that allows the
-  package to define its https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe[CPE
-  identifier]. The available variables are:
-+
---
-** +LIBFOO_CPE_ID_PREFIX+, specifies the prefix of the CPE identifier,
-   i.e the first three fields. When not defined, the default value is
-   +cpe:2.3:a+.
-
-** +LIBFOO_CPE_ID_VENDOR+, specifies the vendor part of the CPE
-   identifier. When not defined, the default value is
-   +<pkgname>_project+.
-
-** +LIBFOO_CPE_ID_PRODUCT+, specifies the product part of the CPE
-   identifier. When not defined, the default value is +<pkgname>+.
-
-** +LIBFOO_CPE_ID_VERSION+, specifies the version part of the CPE
-   identifier. When not defined the default value is
-   +$(LIBFOO_VERSION)+.
-
-** +LIBFOO_CPE_ID_UPDATE+ specifies the _update_ part of the CPE
-   identifier. When not defined the default value is +*+.
---
-+
-If any of those variables is defined, then the generic package
-infrastructure assumes the package provides valid CPE information. In
-this case, the generic package infrastructure will define
-+LIBFOO_CPE_ID+.
-+
-For a host package, if its +LIBFOO_CPE_ID_*+ variables are not
-defined, it inherits the value of those variables from the
-corresponding target package.
-
-The recommended way to define these variables is to use the following
-syntax:
-
-----------------------
-LIBFOO_VERSION = 2.32
-----------------------
-
-Now, the variables that define what should be performed at the
-different steps of the build process.
-
-* +LIBFOO_EXTRACT_CMDS+ lists the actions to be performed to extract
-  the package. This is generally not needed as tarballs are
-  automatically handled by Buildroot. However, if the package uses a
-  non-standard archive format, such as a ZIP or RAR file, or has a
-  tarball with a non-standard organization, this variable allows to
-  override the package infrastructure default behavior.
-
-* +LIBFOO_CONFIGURE_CMDS+ lists the actions to be performed to
-  configure the package before its compilation.
-
-* +LIBFOO_BUILD_CMDS+ lists the actions to be performed to
-  compile the package.
-
-* +HOST_LIBFOO_INSTALL_CMDS+ lists the actions to be performed
-  to install the package, when the package is a host package. The
-  package must install its files to the directory given by
-  +$(HOST_DIR)+. All files, including development files such as
-  headers should be installed, since other packages might be compiled
-  on top of this package.
-
-* +LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET_CMDS+ lists the actions to be
-  performed to install the package to the target directory, when the
-  package is a target package. The package must install its files to
-  the directory given by +$(TARGET_DIR)+. Only the files required for
-  'execution' of the package have to be
-  installed. Header files, static libraries and documentation will be
-  removed again when the target filesystem is finalized.
-
-* +LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS+ lists the actions to be
-  performed to install the package to the staging directory, when the
-  package is a target package. The package must install its files to
-  the directory given by +$(STAGING_DIR)+. All development files
-  should be installed, since they might be needed to compile other
-  packages.
-
-* +LIBFOO_INSTALL_IMAGES_CMDS+ lists the actions to be performed to
-  install the package to the images directory, when the package is a
-  target package. The package must install its files to the directory
-  given by +$(BINARIES_DIR)+. Only files that are binary images (aka
-  images) that do not belong in the +TARGET_DIR+ but are necessary
-  for booting the board should be placed here. For example, a package
-  should utilize this step if it has binaries which would be similar
-  to the kernel image, bootloader or root filesystem images.
-
-* +LIBFOO_INSTALL_INIT_SYSV+, +LIBFOO_INSTALL_INIT_OPENRC+ and
-  +LIBFOO_INSTALL_INIT_SYSTEMD+ list the actions to install init
-  scripts either for the systemV-like init systems (busybox,
-  sysvinit, etc.), openrc or for the systemd units. These commands
-  will be run only when the relevant init system is installed (i.e.
-  if systemd is selected as the init system in the configuration,
-  only +LIBFOO_INSTALL_INIT_SYSTEMD+ will be run). The only exception
-  is when openrc is chosen as init system and +LIBFOO_INSTALL_INIT_OPENRC+
-  has not been set, in such situation +LIBFOO_INSTALL_INIT_SYSV+ will
-  be called, since openrc supports sysv init scripts.
-  When systemd is used as the init system, buildroot will automatically enable
-  all services using the +systemctl preset-all+ command in the final phase of
-  image building. You can add preset files to prevent a particular unit from
-  being automatically enabled by buildroot.
-
-* +LIBFOO_HELP_CMDS+ lists the actions to print the package help, which
-  is included to the main +make help+ output. These commands can print
-  anything in any format.
-  This is seldom used, as packages rarely have custom rules. *Do not use
-  this variable*, unless you really know that you need to print help.
-
-* +LIBFOO_LINUX_CONFIG_FIXUPS+ lists the Linux kernel configuration
-  options that are needed to build and use this package, and without
-  which the package is fundamentally broken. This shall be a set of
-  calls to one of the kconfig tweaking option: `KCONFIG_ENABLE_OPT`,
-  `KCONFIG_DISABLE_OPT`, or `KCONFIG_SET_OPT`.
-  This is seldom used, as package usually have no strict requirements on
-  the kernel options.
-
-The preferred way to define these variables is:
-
-----------------------
-define LIBFOO_CONFIGURE_CMDS
-	action 1
-	action 2
-	action 3
-endef
-----------------------
-
-In the action definitions, you can use the following variables:
-
-* +$(LIBFOO_PKGDIR)+ contains the path to the directory containing the
-  +libfoo.mk+ and +Config.in+ files. This variable is useful when it is
-  necessary to install a file bundled in Buildroot, like a runtime
-  configuration file, a splashscreen image...
-
-* +$(@D)+, which contains the directory in which the package source
-  code has been uncompressed.
-
-* +$(LIBFOO_DL_DIR)+ contains the path to the directory where all the downloads
-  made by Buildroot for +libfoo+ are stored in.
-
-* +$(TARGET_CC)+, +$(TARGET_LD)+, etc. to get the target
-  cross-compilation utilities
-
-* +$(TARGET_CROSS)+ to get the cross-compilation toolchain prefix
-
-* Of course the +$(HOST_DIR)+, +$(STAGING_DIR)+ and +$(TARGET_DIR)+
-  variables to install the packages properly. Those variables point to
-  the global _host_, _staging_ and _target_ directories, unless
-  _per-package directory_ support is used, in which case they point to
-  the current package _host_, _staging_ and _target_ directories. In
-  both cases, it doesn't make any difference from the package point of
-  view: it should simply use +HOST_DIR+, +STAGING_DIR+ and
-  +TARGET_DIR+. See xref:top-level-parallel-build[] for more details
-  about _per-package directory_ support.
-
-Finally, you can also use hooks. See xref:hooks[] for more information.

-=== Gettext integration and interaction with packages
-
-Many packages that support internationalization use the gettext
-library. Dependencies for this library are fairly complicated and
-therefore, deserve some explanation.
-
-The 'glibc' C library integrates a full-blown implementation of
-'gettext', supporting translation. Native Language Support is
-therefore built-in in 'glibc'.
-
-On the other hand, the 'uClibc' and 'musl' C libraries only provide a
-stub implementation of the gettext functionality, which allows to
-compile libraries and programs using gettext functions, but without
-providing the translation capabilities of a full-blown gettext
-implementation. With such C libraries, if real Native Language Support
-is necessary, it can be provided by the +libintl+ library of the
-+gettext+ package.
-
-Due to this, and in order to make sure that Native Language Support is
-properly handled, packages in Buildroot that can use NLS support
-should:
-
-1. Ensure NLS support is enabled when +BR2_SYSTEM_ENABLE_NLS=y+. This
-   is done automatically for 'autotools' packages and therefore should
-   only be done for packages using other package infrastructures.
-
-1. Add +$(TARGET_NLS_DEPENDENCIES)+ to the package
-   +<pkg>_DEPENDENCIES+ variable. This addition should be done
-   unconditionally: the value of this variable is automatically
-   adjusted by the core infrastructure to contain the relevant list of
-   packages. If NLS support is disabled, this variable is empty. If
-   NLS support is enabled, this variable contains +host-gettext+ so
-   that tools needed to compile translation files are available on the
-   host. In addition, if 'uClibc' or 'musl' are used, this variable
-   also contains +gettext+ in order to get the full-blown 'gettext'
-   implementation.
-
-1. If needed, add +$(TARGET_NLS_LIBS)+ to the linker flags, so that
-   the package gets linked with +libintl+. This is generally not
-   needed with 'autotools' packages as they usually detect
-   automatically that they should link with +libintl+. However,
-   packages using other build systems, or problematic autotools-based
-   packages may need this. +$(TARGET_NLS_LIBS)+ should be added
-   unconditionally to the linker flags, as the core automatically
-   makes it empty or defined to +-lintl+ depending on the
-   configuration.
-
-No changes should be made to the +Config.in+ file to support NLS.
-
-Finally, certain packages need some gettext utilities on the target,
-such as the +gettext+ program itself, which allows to retrieve
-translated strings, from the command line. In such a case, the package
-should:
-
-* use +select BR2_PACKAGE_GETTEXT+ in their +Config.in+ file,
-  indicating in a comment above that it's a runtime dependency only.
-
-* not add any +gettext+ dependency in the +DEPENDENCIES+ variable of
-  their +.mk+ file.

-=== Infrastructure for Go packages
-
-This infrastructure applies to Go packages that use the standard
-build system and use bundled dependencies.
-
-[[golang-package-tutorial]]
-
-==== +golang-package+ tutorial
-
-First, let's see how to write a +.mk+ file for a go package,
-with an example :
-
-------------------------
-01: ################################################################################
-02: #
-03: # foo
-04: #
-05: ################################################################################
-06:
-07: FOO_VERSION = 1.0
-08: FOO_SITE = $(call github,bar,foo,$(FOO_VERSION))
-09: FOO_LICENSE = BSD-3-Clause
-10: FOO_LICENSE_FILES = LICENSE
-11:
-12: $(eval $(golang-package))
-------------------------
-
-On line 7, we declare the version of the package.
-
-On line 8, we declare the upstream location of the package, here
-fetched from Github, since a large number of Go packages are hosted on
-Github.
-
-On line 9 and 10, we give licensing details about the package.
-
-Finally, on line 12, we invoke the +golang-package+ macro that
-generates all the Makefile rules that actually allow the package to be
-built.
-
-[[golang-package-reference]]
-
-==== +golang-package+ reference
-
-In their +Config.in+ file, packages using the +golang-package+
-infrastructure should depend on +BR2_PACKAGE_HOST_GO_TARGET_ARCH_SUPPORTS+
-because Buildroot will automatically add a dependency on +host-go+
-to such packages.
-If you need CGO support in your package, you must add a dependency on
-+BR2_PACKAGE_HOST_GO_TARGET_CGO_LINKING_SUPPORTS+.
-
-The main macro of the Go package infrastructure is
-+golang-package+. It is similar to the +generic-package+ macro. The
-ability to build host packages is also available, with the
-+host-golang-package+ macro.
-Host packages built by +host-golang-package+ macro should depend on
-BR2_PACKAGE_HOST_GO_HOST_ARCH_SUPPORTS.
-
-Just like the generic infrastructure, the Go infrastructure works
-by defining a number of variables before calling the +golang-package+.
-
-All the package metadata information variables that exist in the
-xref:generic-package-reference[generic package infrastructure] also
-exist in the Go infrastructure: +FOO_VERSION+, +FOO_SOURCE+,
-+FOO_PATCH+, +FOO_SITE+, +FOO_SUBDIR+, +FOO_DEPENDENCIES+,
-+FOO_LICENSE+, +FOO_LICENSE_FILES+, +FOO_INSTALL_STAGING+, etc.
-
-Note that it is not necessary to add +host-go+ in the
-+FOO_DEPENDENCIES+ variable of a package, since this basic dependency
-is automatically added as needed by the Go package infrastructure.
-
-A few additional variables, specific to the Go infrastructure, can
-optionally be defined, depending on the package's needs. Many of them
-are only useful in very specific cases, typical packages will
-therefore only use a few of them, or none.
-
-* The package must specify its Go module name in the +FOO_GOMOD+
-  variable. If not specified, it defaults to
-  +URL-domain/1st-part-of-URL/2nd-part-of-URL+, e.g +FOO_GOMOD+ will
-  take the value +github.com/bar/foo+ for a package that specifies
-  +FOO_SITE = $(call github,bar,foo,$(FOO_VERSION))+. The Go package
-  infrastructure will automatically generate a minimal +go.mod+ file
-  in the package source tree if it doesn't exist.
-
-* +FOO_LDFLAGS+ and +FOO_TAGS+ can be used to pass respectively the
-  +LDFLAGS+ or the +TAGS+ to the +go+ build command.
-
-* +FOO_BUILD_TARGETS+ can be used to pass the list of targets that
-  should be built. If +FOO_BUILD_TARGETS+ is not specified, it
-  defaults to +.+. We then have two cases:
-
-** +FOO_BUILD_TARGETS+ is +.+. In this case, we assume only one binary
-   will be produced, and that by default we name it after the package
-   name. If that is not appropriate, the name of the produced binary
-   can be overridden using +FOO_BIN_NAME+.
-
-** +FOO_BUILD_TARGETS+ is not +.+. In this case, we iterate over the
-   values to build each target, and for each produced a binary that is
-   the non-directory component of the target. For example if
-   +FOO_BUILD_TARGETS = cmd/docker cmd/dockerd+ the binaries produced
-   are +docker+ and +dockerd+.
-
-* +FOO_INSTALL_BINS+ can be used to pass the list of binaries that
-  should be installed in +/usr/bin+ on the target. If
-  +FOO_INSTALL_BINS+ is not specified, it defaults to the lower-case
-  name of package.
-
-With the Go infrastructure, all the steps required to build and
-install the packages are already defined, and they generally work well
-for most Go-based packages. However, when required, it is still
-possible to customize what is done in any particular step:
-
-* By adding a post-operation hook (after extract, patch, configure,
-  build or install). See xref:hooks[] for details.
-
-* By overriding one of the steps. For example, even if the Go
-  infrastructure is used, if the package +.mk+ file defines its own
-  +FOO_BUILD_CMDS+ variable, it will be used instead of the default Go
-  one. However, using this method should be restricted to very
-  specific cases. Do not use it in the general case.

-[[hooks]]
-=== Hooks available in the various build steps
-
-The generic infrastructure (and as a result also the derived autotools
-and cmake infrastructures) allow packages to specify hooks.
-These define further actions to perform after existing steps.
-Most hooks aren't really useful for generic packages, since the +.mk+
-file already has full control over the actions performed in each step
-of the package construction.
-
-The following hook points are available:

-
-* +LIBFOO_PRE_EXTRACT_HOOKS+
-* +LIBFOO_POST_EXTRACT_HOOKS+

-endef
-
-LIBFOO_POST_PATCH_HOOKS += LIBFOO_POST_PATCH_FIXUP

-
-[[hooks-rsync]]
-==== Using the +POST_RSYNC+ hook
-The +POST_RSYNC+ hook is run only for packages that use a local source,
-either through the +local+ site method or the +OVERRIDE_SRCDIR+
-mechanism. In this case, package sources are copied using +rsync+ from
-the local location into the buildroot build directory. The +rsync+
-command does not copy all files from the source directory, though.
-Files belonging to a version control system, like the directories
-+.git+, +.hg+, etc. are not copied. For most packages this is
-sufficient, but a given package can perform additional actions using
-the +POST_RSYNC+ hook.
-
-In principle, the hook can contain any command you want. One specific
-use case, though, is the intentional copying of the version control
-directory using +rsync+. The +rsync+ command you use in the hook can, among
-others, use the following variables:
-
-* +$(SRCDIR)+: the path to the overridden source directory
-* +$(@D)+: the path to the build directory
-
-==== Target-finalize hook
-
-Packages may also register hooks in +LIBFOO_TARGET_FINALIZE_HOOKS+.
-These hooks are run after all packages are built, but before the
-filesystem images are generated. They are seldom used, and your
-package probably do not need them.

-=== Infrastructure for packages using kconfig for configuration files
-
-A popular way for a software package to handle user-specified
-configuration is +kconfig+. Among others, it is used by the Linux
-kernel, Busybox, and Buildroot itself. The presence of a .config file
-and a +menuconfig+ target are two well-known symptoms of kconfig being
-used.
-
-Buildroot features an infrastructure for packages that use kconfig for
-their configuration. This infrastructure provides the necessary logic to
-expose the package's +menuconfig+ target as +foo-menuconfig+ in
-Buildroot, and to handle the copying back and forth of the configuration
-file in a correct way.
-
-The +kconfig-package+ infrastructure is based on the +generic-package+
-infrastructure. All variables supported by +generic-package+ are
-available in +kconfig-package+ as well. See
-xref:generic-package-reference[] for more details.
-
-In order to use the +kconfig-package+ infrastructure for a Buildroot
-package, the minimally required lines in the +.mk+ file, in addition to
-the variables required by the +generic-package+ infrastructure, are:
-
-------------------------------
-FOO_KCONFIG_FILE = reference-to-source-configuration-file
-
-$(eval $(kconfig-package))
-------------------------------
-
-This snippet creates the following make targets:
-
-* +foo-menuconfig+, which calls the package's +menuconfig+ target
-
-* +foo-update-config+, which copies the configuration back to the
-  source configuration file. It is not possible to use this target
-  when fragment files are set.
-
-* +foo-update-defconfig+, which copies the configuration back to the
-  source configuration file. The configuration file will only list the
-  options that differ from the default values. It is not possible to
-  use this target when fragment files are set.
-
-* +foo-diff-config+, which outputs the differences between the current
-  configuration and the one defined in the Buildroot configuration for
-  this kconfig package. The output is useful to identify the
-  configuration changes that may have to be propagated to
-  configuration fragments for example.
-
-and ensures that the source configuration file is copied to the build
-directory at the right moment.
-
-There are two options to specify a configuration file to use, either
-+FOO_KCONFIG_FILE+ (as in the example, above) or +FOO_KCONFIG_DEFCONFIG+.
-It is mandatory to provide either, but not both:
-
-* +FOO_KCONFIG_FILE+ specifies the path to a defconfig or full-config file
-  to be used to configure the package.
-
-* +FOO_KCONFIG_DEFCONFIG+ specifies the defconfig 'make' rule to call to
-  configure the package.
-
-In addition to these minimally required lines, several optional variables can
-be set to suit the needs of the package under consideration:
-
-* +FOO_KCONFIG_EDITORS+: a space-separated list of kconfig editors to
-  support, for example 'menuconfig xconfig'. By default, 'menuconfig'.
-
-* +FOO_KCONFIG_FRAGMENT_FILES+: a space-separated list of configuration
-  fragment files that are merged to the main configuration file.
-  Fragment files are typically used when there is a desire to stay in sync
-  with an upstream (def)config file, with some minor modifications.
-
-* +FOO_KCONFIG_OPTS+: extra options to pass when calling the kconfig
-  editors. This may need to include '$(FOO_MAKE_OPTS)', for example. By
-  default, empty.
-
-* +FOO_KCONFIG_FIXUP_CMDS+: a list of shell commands needed to fixup the
-  configuration file after copying it or running a kconfig editor. Such
-  commands may be needed to ensure a configuration consistent with other
-  configuration of Buildroot, for example. By default, empty.
-
-* +FOO_KCONFIG_DOTCONFIG+: path (with filename) of the +.config+ file,
-  relative to the package source tree. The default, +.config+, should
-  be well suited for all packages that use the standard kconfig
-  infrastructure as inherited from the Linux kernel; some packages use
-  a derivative of kconfig that use a different location.
-
-* +FOO_KCONFIG_DEPENDENCIES+: the list of packages (most probably, host
-  packages) that need to be built before this package's kconfig is
-  interpreted. Seldom used. By default, empty.
-
-* +FOO_KCONFIG_SUPPORTS_DEFCONFIG+: whether the package's kconfig system
-  supports using defconfig files; few packages do not. By default, 'YES'.

-=== Infrastructure for packages building kernel modules
-
-Buildroot offers a helper infrastructure to make it easy to write packages that
-build and install Linux kernel modules. Some packages only contain a kernel
-module, other packages contain programs and libraries in addition to kernel
-modules. Buildroot's helper infrastructure supports either case.
-
-[[kernel-module-tutorial]]
-==== +kernel-module+ tutorial
-
-Let's start with an example on how to prepare a simple package that only
-builds a kernel module, and no other component:
-
-----
-01: ################################################################################
-02: #
-03: # foo
-04: #
-05: ################################################################################
-06: 
-07: FOO_VERSION = 1.2.3
-08: FOO_SOURCE = foo-$(FOO_VERSION).tar.xz
-09: FOO_SITE = http://www.foosoftware.org/download
-10: FOO_LICENSE = GPL-2.0
-11: FOO_LICENSE_FILES = COPYING
-12: 
-13: $(eval $(kernel-module))
-14: $(eval $(generic-package))
-----
-
-Lines 7-11 define the usual meta-data to specify the version, archive name,
-remote URI where to find the package source, licensing information.
-
-On line 13, we invoke the +kernel-module+ helper infrastructure, that
-generates all the appropriate Makefile rules and variables to build
-that kernel module.
-
-Finally, on line 14, we invoke the
-xref:generic-package-tutorial[+generic-package+ infrastructure].
-
-The dependency on +linux+ is automatically added, so it is not needed to
-specify it in +FOO_DEPENDENCIES+.
-
-What you may have noticed is that, unlike other package infrastructures,
-we explicitly invoke a second infrastructure. This allows a package to
-build a kernel module, but also, if needed, use any one of other package
-infrastructures to build normal userland components (libraries,
-executables...). Using the +kernel-module+ infrastructure on its own is
-not sufficient; another package infrastructure *must* be used.
-
-Let's look at a more complex example:
-
-----
-01: ################################################################################
-02: #
-03: # foo
-04: #
-05: ################################################################################
-06: 
-07: FOO_VERSION = 1.2.3
-08: FOO_SOURCE = foo-$(FOO_VERSION).tar.xz

-10: FOO_LICENSE = GPL-2.0
-11: FOO_LICENSE_FILES = COPYING

-13: FOO_MODULE_SUBDIRS = driver/base
-14: FOO_MODULE_MAKE_OPTS = KVERSION=$(LINUX_VERSION_PROBED)
-15: 
-16: ifeq ($(BR2_PACKAGE_LIBBAR),y)
-17: FOO_DEPENDENCIES = libbar
-18: FOO_CONF_OPTS = --enable-bar
-19: FOO_MODULE_SUBDIRS += driver/bar
-20: else
-21: FOO_CONF_OPTS = --disable-bar
-22: endif
-23: 
-24: $(eval $(kernel-module))
-26: $(eval $(autotools-package))
-----
-
-Here, we see that we have an autotools-based package, that also builds
-the kernel module located in sub-directory +driver/base+ and, if libbar
-is enabled, the kernel module located in sub-directory +driver/bar+, and
-defines the variable +KVERSION+ to be passed to the Linux buildsystem
-when building the module(s).
-
-
-[[kernel-module-reference]]
-==== +kernel-module+ reference
-
-The main macro for the  kernel module infrastructure is +kernel-module+.
-Unlike other package infrastructures, it is not stand-alone, and requires
-any of the other +*-package+ macros be called after it.
-
-The +kernel-module+ macro defines post-build and post-target-install
-hooks to build the kernel modules. If the package's +.mk+ needs access
-to the built kernel modules, it should do so in a post-build hook,
-*registered after* the call to +kernel-module+. Similarly, if the
-package's +.mk+ needs access to the kernel module after it has been
-installed, it should do so in a post-install hook, *registered after*
-the call to +kernel-module+. Here's an example:
-
-----
-$(eval $(kernel-module))
-
-define FOO_DO_STUFF_WITH_KERNEL_MODULE
-    # Do something with it...
-endef
-FOO_POST_BUILD_HOOKS += FOO_DO_STUFF_WITH_KERNEL_MODULE
-
-$(eval $(generic-package))
-----
-
-Finally, unlike the other package infrastructures, there is no
-+host-kernel-module+ variant to build a host kernel module.
-
-The following additional variables can optionally be defined to further
-configure the build of the kernel module:
-
-* +FOO_MODULE_SUBDIRS+ may be set to one or more sub-directories (relative
-  to the package source top-directory) where the kernel module sources are.
-  If empty or not set, the sources for the kernel module(s) are considered
-  to be located at the top of the package source tree.
-
-* +FOO_MODULE_MAKE_OPTS+ may be set to contain extra variable definitions
-  to pass to the Linux buildsystem.
-
-[[kernel-variables]]
-You may also reference (but you may *not* set!) those variables:
-
- * +LINUX_DIR+ contains the path to where the Linux kernel has been
-   extracted and built.
-
- * +LINUX_VERSION+ contains the version string as configured by the user.
-
- * +LINUX_VERSION_PROBED+ contains the real version string of the kernel,
-   retrieved with running `make -C $(LINUX_DIR) kernelrelease`
-
- * +KERNEL_ARCH+ contains the name of the current architecture, like `arm`,
-   `mips`...

-=== Infrastructure specific to the Linux kernel package
-
-The Linux kernel package can use some specific infrastructures based on package
-hooks for building Linux kernel tools or/and building Linux kernel extensions.
-
-[[linux-kernel-tools]]
-==== linux-kernel-tools
-
-Buildroot offers a helper infrastructure to build some userspace tools
-for the target available within the Linux kernel sources. Since their
-source code is part of the kernel source code, a special package,
-+linux-tools+, exists and re-uses the sources of the Linux kernel that
-runs on the target.
-
-Let's look at an example of a Linux tool. For a new Linux tool named
-+foo+, create a new menu entry in the existing
-+package/linux-tools/Config.in+.  This file will contain the option
-descriptions related to each kernel tool that will be used and
-displayed in the configuration tool. It would basically look like:
-
-------------------------------
-01: config BR2_PACKAGE_LINUX_TOOLS_FOO
-02: 	bool "foo"
-03: 	select BR2_PACKAGE_LINUX_TOOLS
-04: 	help
-05: 	  This is a comment that explains what foo kernel tool is.
-06:
-07: 	  http://foosoftware.org/foo/
-------------------------------
-
-The name of the option starts with the prefix +BR2_PACKAGE_LINUX_TOOLS_+,
-followed by the uppercase name of the tool (like is done for packages).
-
-.Note
-Unlike other packages, the +linux-tools+ package options appear in the
-+linux+ kernel menu, under the `Linux Kernel Tools` sub-menu, not under
-the `Target packages` main menu.
-
-Then for each linux tool, add a new +.mk.in+ file named
-+package/linux-tools/linux-tool-foo.mk.in+. It would basically look like:
-
-------------------------------
-01: ################################################################################

-
-.Note

-package infrastructure! Linux tools are not packages by themselves,
-they are part of the +linux-tools+ package.
-
-[[linux-kernel-ext]]
-==== linux-kernel-extensions
-
-Some packages provide new features that require the Linux kernel tree
-to be modified. This can be in the form of patches to be applied on
-the kernel tree, or in the form of new files to be added to the
-tree. The Buildroot's Linux kernel extensions infrastructure provides
-a simple solution to automatically do this, just after the kernel
-sources are extracted and before the kernel patches are
-applied. Examples of extensions packaged using this mechanism are the
-real-time extensions Xenomai and RTAI, as well as the set of
-out-of-tree LCD screens drivers +fbtft+.
-
-Let's look at an example on how to add a new Linux extension +foo+.
-
-First, create the package +foo+ that provides the extension: this
-package is a standard package; see the previous chapters on how to
-create such a package. This package is in charge of downloading the
-sources archive, checking the hash, defining the licence informations
-and building user space tools if any.
-
-Then create the 'Linux extension' proper: create a new menu entry in
-the existing +linux/Config.ext.in+. This file contains the option
-descriptions related to each kernel extension that will be used and
-displayed in the configuration tool. It would basically look like:
-
-------------------------------
-01: config BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_EXT_FOO
-02: 	bool "foo"
-03: 	help
-04: 	  This is a comment that explains what foo kernel extension is.
-05:
-06: 	  http://foosoftware.org/foo/
-------------------------------
-
-Then for each linux extension, add a new +.mk+ file named
-+linux/linux-ext-foo.mk+. It should basically contain:
-
-------------------------------
-01: ################################################################################

-11: endef
---------------------------------
-
-On line 7, we add the Linux extension +foo+ to the list of available
-Linux extensions.
-
-On line 9-11, we define what should be done by the extension to modify

-------------------------
-
-On line 7, we declare the version of the package (the same as in the rockspec,
-which is the concatenation of the upstream version and the rockspec revision,
-separated by a hyphen '-').
-
-On line 8, we declare that the package is called "foo" on LuaRocks. In
-Buildroot, we give Lua-related packages a name that starts with "lua", so the
-Buildroot name is different from the upstream name. +LUA_FOO_NAME_UPSTREAM+
-makes the link between the two names.
-
-On line 9, we declare our dependencies against native libraries, so that they
-are built before the build process of our package starts.
-
-On lines 11-12, we tell Buildroot to pass custom options to LuaRocks when it is
-building the package.
-
-On lines 13-14, we specify the licensing terms for the package.
-
-Finally, on line 16, we invoke the +luarocks-package+
-macro that generates all the Makefile rules that actually allows the
-package to be built.
-
-Most of these details can be retrieved from the +rock+ and +rockspec+.
-So, this file and the Config.in file can be generated by running the
-command +luarocks buildroot foo lua-foo+ in the Buildroot
-directory. This command runs a specific Buildroot addon of +luarocks+
-that will automatically generate a Buildroot package. The result must
-still be manually inspected and possibly modified.
-
-* The +package/Config.in+ file has to be updated manually to include the
-  generated Config.in files.

-LuaRocks is a deployment and management system for Lua modules, and supports
-various +build.type+: +builtin+, +make+ and +cmake+. In the context of
-Buildroot, the +luarocks-package+ infrastructure only supports the +builtin+
-mode. LuaRocks packages that use the +make+ or +cmake+ build mechanisms
-should instead be packaged using the +generic-package+ and +cmake-package+
-infrastructures in Buildroot, respectively.
-
-The main macro of the LuaRocks package infrastructure is +luarocks-package+:
-like +generic-package+ it works by defining a number of variables providing

-
-Just like the generic infrastructure, the LuaRocks infrastructure works
-by defining a number of variables before calling the +luarocks-package+

-
-First, all the package metadata information variables that exist in

-+LUA_FOO_DEPENDENCIES+, +LUA_FOO_LICENSE+, +LUA_FOO_LICENSE_FILES+.
-
-Two of them are populated by the LuaRocks infrastructure (for the

-
-A few additional variables, specific to the LuaRocks infrastructure, are

-http://mesonbuild.com[Meson] is an open source build system meant to be both
-extremely fast, and, even more importantly, as user friendly as possible. It
-uses https://ninja-build.org[Ninja] as a companion tool to perform the actual
-build operations.
-
-Let's see how to write a +.mk+ file for a Meson-based package, with an example:
-
-------------------------------
-01: ################################################################################
-02: #
-03: # foo

-18: FOO_DEPENDENCIES += baz
-19: else
-20: FOO_CONF_OPTS += -Dbaz=false
-21: endif
-22:
-23: $(eval $(meson-package))
---------------------------------
-
-The Makefile starts with the definition of the standard variables for package
-declaration (lines 7 to 11).
-
-On line line 23, we invoke the +meson-package+ macro that generates all the
-Makefile rules that actually allows the package to be built.
-
-In the example, +host-pkgconf+ and +bar+ are declared as dependencies in
-+FOO_DEPENDENCIES+ at line 14 because the Meson build file of +foo+ uses
-`pkg-config` to determine the compilation flags and libraries of package +bar+.
-
-Note that it is not necessary to add +host-meson+ in the +FOO_DEPENDENCIES+
-variable of a package, since this basic dependency is automatically added as
-needed by the Meson package infrastructure.
-
-If the "baz" package is selected, then support for the "baz" feature in "foo" is
-activated by adding +-Dbaz=true+ to +FOO_CONF_OPTS+ at line 17, as specified in
-the +meson_options.txt+ file in "foo" source tree. The "baz" package is also
-added to +FOO_DEPENDENCIES+. Note that the support for +baz+ is explicitly
-disabled at line 20, if the package is not selected.
-
-To sum it up, to add a new meson-based package, the Makefile example can be
-copied verbatim then edited to replace all occurences of +FOO+ with the
-uppercase name of the new package and update the values of the standard
-variables.
-
-[[meson-package-reference]]
-
-==== +meson-package+ reference
-
-The main macro of the Meson package infrastructure is +meson-package+. It is
-similar to the +generic-package+ macro. The ability to have target and host
-packages is also available, with the +host-meson-package+ macro.
-
-Just like the generic infrastructure, the Meson infrastructure works by defining
-a number of variables before calling the +meson-package+ macro.
-
-First, all the package metadata information variables that exist in the generic
-infrastructure also exist in the Meson infrastructure: +FOO_VERSION+,
-+FOO_SOURCE+, +FOO_PATCH+, +FOO_SITE+, +FOO_SUBDIR+, +FOO_DEPENDENCIES+,
-+FOO_INSTALL_STAGING+, +FOO_INSTALL_TARGET+.
-
-A few additional variables, specific to the Meson infrastructure, can also be
-defined. Many of them are only useful in very specific cases, typical packages
-will therefore only use a few of them.
-
-* +FOO_SUBDIR+ may contain the name of a subdirectory inside the
-  package that contains the main meson.build file. This is useful,
-  if for example, the main meson.build file is not at the root of
-  the tree extracted by the tarball. If +HOST_FOO_SUBDIR+ is not
-  specified, it defaults to +FOO_SUBDIR+.
-
-* +FOO_CONF_ENV+, to specify additional environment variables to pass to
-  +meson+ for the configuration step. By default, empty.
-
-* +FOO_CONF_OPTS+, to specify additional options to pass to +meson+ for the
-  configuration step. By default, empty.
-
-* +FOO_CFLAGS+, to specify compiler arguments added to the package specific
-  +cross-compile.conf+ file +c_args+ property. By default, the value of
-  +TARGET_CFLAGS+.
-
-* +FOO_CXXFLAGS+, to specify compiler arguments added to the package specific
-  +cross-compile.conf+ file +cpp_args+ property. By default, the value of
-  +TARGET_CXXFLAGS+.
-
-* +FOO_LDFLAGS+, to specify compiler arguments added to the package specific
-  +cross-compile.conf+ file +c_link_args+ and +cpp_link_args+ properties. By
-  default, the value of +TARGET_LDFLAGS+.
-
-* +FOO_MESON_EXTRA_BINARIES+, to specify a space-separated list of programs
-  to add to the `[binaries]` section of the meson `cross-compilation.conf`
-  configuration file. The format is `program-name='/path/to/program'`, with
-  no space around the +=+ sign, and with the path of the program between
-  single quotes. By default, empty. Note that Buildroot already sets the
-  correct values for +c+, +cpp+, +ar+, +strip+, and +pkgconfig+.
-
-* +FOO_MESON_EXTRA_PROPERTIES+, to specify a space-separated list of
-  properties to add to the `[properties]` section of the meson
-  `cross-compilation.conf` configuration file. The format is
-  `property-name=<value>` with no space around the +=+ sign, and with
-  single quotes around string values. By default, empty. Note that
-  Buildroot already sets values for +needs_exe_wrapper+, +c_args+,
-  +c_link_args+, +cpp_args+, +cpp_link_args+, +sys_root+, and
-  +pkg_config_libdir+.
-
-* +FOO_NINJA_ENV+, to specify additional environment variables to pass to
-  +ninja+, meson companion tool in charge of the build operations. By default,
-  empty.
-
-* +FOO_NINJA_OPTS+, to specify a space-separated list of targets to build. By
-  default, empty, to build the default target(s).

-with an example :

-12: PERL_FOO_BAR_LICENSE_FILES = LICENSE
-13: PERL_FOO_BAR_DISTNAME = Foo-Bar
-14:
-15: $(eval $(perl-package))
-------------------------
-
-On line 7, we declare the version of the package.
-
-On line 8 and 9, we declare the name of the tarball and the location
-of the tarball on a CPAN server. Buildroot will automatically download
-the tarball from this location.
-
-On line 10, we declare our dependencies, so that they are built
-before the build process of our package starts.
-
-On line 11 and 12, we give licensing details about the package (its
-license on line 11, and the file containing the license text on line
-12).
-
-On line 13, the name of the distribution as needed by the script
-+utils/scancpan+ (in order to regenerate/upgrade these package files).
-
-Finally, on line 15, we invoke the +perl-package+ macro that
-generates all the Makefile rules that actually allow the package to be
-built.
-
-Most of these data can be retrieved from https://metacpan.org/.
-So, this file and the Config.in can be generated by running
-the script +utils/scancpan Foo-Bar+ in the Buildroot directory
-(or in a br2-external tree).
-This script creates a Config.in file and foo-bar.mk file for the
-requested package, and also recursively for all dependencies specified by
-CPAN. You should still manually edit the result. In particular, the
-following things should be checked.
-
-* If the perl module links with a shared library that is provided by
-  another (non-perl) package, this dependency is not added automatically.
-  It has to be added manually to +PERL_FOO_BAR_DEPENDENCIES+.
-* The +package/Config.in+ file has to be updated manually to include the
-  generated Config.in files. As a hint, the +scancpan+ script prints out
-  the required +source "..."+ statements, sorted alphabetically.
-
-[[perl-package-reference]]
-
-==== +perl-package+ reference
-
-As a policy, packages that provide Perl/CPAN modules should all be
-named +perl-<something>+ in Buildroot.
-
-This infrastructure handles various Perl build systems :
-+ExtUtils-MakeMaker+ (EUMM), +Module-Build+ (MB) and +Module-Build-Tiny+.
-+Build.PL+ is preferred by default when a package provides a +Makefile.PL+
-and a +Build.PL+.
-
-The main macro of the Perl/CPAN package infrastructure is
-+perl-package+. It is similar to the +generic-package+ macro. The ability to
-have target and host packages is also available, with the
-+host-perl-package+ macro.
-
-Just like the generic infrastructure, the Perl/CPAN infrastructure
-works by defining a number of variables before calling the
-+perl-package+ macro.
-
-First, all the package metadata information variables that exist in the
-generic infrastructure also exist in the Perl/CPAN infrastructure:
-+PERL_FOO_VERSION+, +PERL_FOO_SOURCE+,
-+PERL_FOO_PATCH+, +PERL_FOO_SITE+,
-+PERL_FOO_SUBDIR+, +PERL_FOO_DEPENDENCIES+,
-+PERL_FOO_INSTALL_TARGET+.
-
-Note that setting +PERL_FOO_INSTALL_STAGING+ to +YES+ has no effect
-unless a +PERL_FOO_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS+ variable is defined. The perl
-infrastructure doesn't define these commands since Perl modules generally
-don't need to be installed to the +staging+ directory.
-
-A few additional variables, specific to the Perl/CPAN infrastructure,
-can also be defined. Many of them are only useful in very specific
-cases, typical packages will therefore only use a few of them.
-
-* +PERL_FOO_PREFER_INSTALLER+/+HOST_PERL_FOO_PREFER_INSTALLER+,
-  specifies the preferred installation method. Possible values are
-  +EUMM+ (for +Makefile.PL+ based installation using
-  +ExtUtils-MakeMaker+) and +MB+ (for +Build.PL+ based installation
-  using +Module-Build+). This variable is only used when the package
-  provides both installation methods.
-
-* +PERL_FOO_CONF_ENV+/+HOST_PERL_FOO_CONF_ENV+, to specify additional
-  environment variables to pass to the +perl Makefile.PL+ or +perl Build.PL+.
-  By default, empty.
-
-* +PERL_FOO_CONF_OPTS+/+HOST_PERL_FOO_CONF_OPTS+, to specify additional
-  configure options to pass to the +perl Makefile.PL+ or +perl Build.PL+.
-  By default, empty.
-
-* +PERL_FOO_BUILD_OPTS+/+HOST_PERL_FOO_BUILD_OPTS+, to specify additional
-  options to pass to +make pure_all+ or +perl Build build+ in the build step.
-  By default, empty.
-
-* +PERL_FOO_INSTALL_TARGET_OPTS+, to specify additional options to
-  pass to +make pure_install+ or +perl Build install+ in the install step.
-  By default, empty.
-
-* +HOST_PERL_FOO_INSTALL_OPTS+, to specify additional options to
-  pass to +make pure_install+ or +perl Build install+ in the install step.
-  By default, empty.

-=== Infrastructure for Python packages

-==== +python-package+ tutorial
-
-First, let's see how to write a +.mk+ file for a Python package,
-with an example :
-
-------------------------

-07: PYTHON_FOO_VERSION = 1.0

-14: PYTHON_FOO_SETUP_TYPE = distutils
-15:
-16: $(eval $(python-package))
-------------------------
-
-On line 7, we declare the version of the package.
-
-On line 8 and 9, we declare the name of the tarball (xz-ed tarball
-recommended) and the location of the tarball on the Web. Buildroot
-will automatically download the tarball from this location.
-
-On line 10 and 11, we give licensing details about the package (its
-license on line 10, and the file containing the license text on line
-11).
-
-On line 12, we tell Buildroot to pass custom options to the Python
-+setup.py+ script when it is configuring the package.
-
-On line 13, we declare our dependencies, so that they are built
-before the build process of our package starts.
-
-On line 14, we declare the specific Python build system being used. In
-this case the +distutils+ Python build system is used. The two
-supported ones are +distutils+ and +setuptools+.
-
-Finally, on line 16, we invoke the +python-package+ macro that
-generates all the Makefile rules that actually allow the package to be
-built.
-
-[[python-package-reference]]
-
-==== +python-package+ reference
-
-As a policy, packages that merely provide Python modules should all be
-named +python-<something>+ in Buildroot. Other packages that use the
-Python build system, but are not Python modules, can freely choose
-their name (existing examples in Buildroot are +scons+ and
-+supervisor+).
-
-Packages that are only compatible with one version of Python (as in:
-Python 2 or Python 3) should depend on that version explicitely in
-their +Config.in+ file (+BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON+ for Python 2,
-+BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON3+ for Python 3).  Packages that are compatible
-with both versions should not explicitely depend on them in their
-+Config.in+ file, since that condition is already expressed for the
-whole "External python modules" menu.
-
-The main macro of the Python package infrastructure is
-+python-package+. It is similar to the +generic-package+ macro. It is
-also possible to create Python host packages with the
-+host-python-package+ macro.
-
-Just like the generic infrastructure, the Python infrastructure works
-by defining a number of variables before calling the +python-package+
-or +host-python-package+ macros.
-
-All the package metadata information variables that exist in the
-xref:generic-package-reference[generic package infrastructure] also
-exist in the Python infrastructure: +PYTHON_FOO_VERSION+,
-+PYTHON_FOO_SOURCE+, +PYTHON_FOO_PATCH+, +PYTHON_FOO_SITE+,
-+PYTHON_FOO_SUBDIR+, +PYTHON_FOO_DEPENDENCIES+, +PYTHON_FOO_LICENSE+,
-+PYTHON_FOO_LICENSE_FILES+, +PYTHON_FOO_INSTALL_STAGING+, etc.
-
-Note that:
-
- * It is not necessary to add +python+ or +host-python+ in the
-   +PYTHON_FOO_DEPENDENCIES+ variable of a package, since these basic
-   dependencies are automatically added as needed by the Python
-   package infrastructure.
-
- * Similarly, it is not needed to add +host-setuptools+ to
-   +PYTHON_FOO_DEPENDENCIES+ for setuptools-based packages, since it's
-   automatically added by the Python infrastructure as needed.
-
-One variable specific to the Python infrastructure is mandatory:
-
-* +PYTHON_FOO_SETUP_TYPE+, to define which Python build system is used
-  by the package. The two supported values are +distutils+ and
-  +setuptools+. If you don't know which one is used in your package,
-  look at the +setup.py+ file in your package source code, and see
-  whether it imports things from the +distutils+ module or the
-  +setuptools+ module.
-
-A few additional variables, specific to the Python infrastructure, can
-optionally be defined, depending on the package's needs. Many of them
-are only useful in very specific cases, typical packages will
-therefore only use a few of them, or none.
-
-* +PYTHON_FOO_SUBDIR+ may contain the name of a subdirectory inside the
-  package that contains the main +setup.py+ file. This is useful,
-  if for example, the main +setup.py+ file is not at the root of
-  the tree extracted by the tarball. If +HOST_PYTHON_FOO_SUBDIR+ is not
-  specified, it defaults to +PYTHON_FOO_SUBDIR+.
-
-* +PYTHON_FOO_ENV+, to specify additional environment variables to
-  pass to the Python +setup.py+ script (for both the build and install
-  steps). Note that the infrastructure is automatically passing
-  several standard variables, defined in +PKG_PYTHON_DISTUTILS_ENV+
-  (for distutils target packages), +HOST_PKG_PYTHON_DISTUTILS_ENV+
-  (for distutils host packages), +PKG_PYTHON_SETUPTOOLS_ENV+ (for
-  setuptools target packages) and +HOST_PKG_PYTHON_SETUPTOOLS_ENV+
-  (for setuptools host packages).
-
-* +PYTHON_FOO_BUILD_OPTS+, to specify additional options to pass to the
-  Python +setup.py+ script during the build step. For target distutils
-  packages, the +PKG_PYTHON_DISTUTILS_BUILD_OPTS+ options are already
-  passed automatically by the infrastructure.
-
-* +PYTHON_FOO_INSTALL_TARGET_OPTS+, +PYTHON_FOO_INSTALL_STAGING_OPTS+,
-  +HOST_PYTHON_FOO_INSTALL_OPTS+ to specify additional options to pass
-  to the Python +setup.py+ script during the target installation step,
-  the staging installation step or the host installation,
-  respectively. Note that the infrastructure is automatically passing
-  some options, defined in +PKG_PYTHON_DISTUTILS_INSTALL_TARGET_OPTS+
-  or +PKG_PYTHON_DISTUTILS_INSTALL_STAGING_OPTS+ (for target distutils
-  packages), +HOST_PKG_PYTHON_DISTUTILS_INSTALL_OPTS+ (for host
-  distutils packages), +PKG_PYTHON_SETUPTOOLS_INSTALL_TARGET_OPTS+ or
-  +PKG_PYTHON_SETUPTOOLS_INSTALL_STAGING_OPTS+ (for target setuptools
-  packages) and +HOST_PKG_PYTHON_SETUPTOOLS_INSTALL_OPTS+ (for host
-  setuptools packages).
-
-* +HOST_PYTHON_FOO_NEEDS_HOST_PYTHON+, to define the host python
-  interpreter. The usage of this variable is limited to host
-  packages. The two supported value are +python2+ and +python3+. It
-  will ensure the right host python package is available and will
-  invoke it for the build. If some build steps are overloaded, the
-  right python interpreter must be explicitly called in the commands.
-
-With the Python infrastructure, all the steps required to build and
-install the packages are already defined, and they generally work well
-for most Python-based packages. However, when required, it is still
-possible to customize what is done in any particular step:
-
-* By adding a post-operation hook (after extract, patch, configure,
-  build or install). See xref:hooks[] for details.
-
-* By overriding one of the steps. For example, even if the Python
-  infrastructure is used, if the package +.mk+ file defines its own
-  +PYTHON_FOO_BUILD_CMDS+ variable, it will be used instead of the
-  default Python one. However, using this method should be restricted
-  to very specific cases. Do not use it in the general case.

-[[scanpypi]]
-
-==== Generating a +python-package+ from a PyPI repository
-
-If the Python package for which you would like to create a Buildroot
-package is available on PyPI, you may want to use the +scanpypi+ tool
-located in +utils/+ to automate the process.
-
-You can find the list of existing PyPI packages
-https://pypi.python.org[here].
-
-+scanpypi+ requires Python's +setuptools+ package to be installed on
-your host.
-
-When at the root of your buildroot directory just do :
-
------------------------
-utils/scanpypi foo bar -o package
------------------------
-
-This will generate packages +python-foo+ and +python-bar+ in the package
-folder if they exist on https://pypi.python.org.
-
-Find the +external python modules+ menu and insert your package inside.
-Keep in mind that the items inside a menu should be in alphabetical order.
-
-Please keep in mind that you'll most likely have to manually check the
-package for any mistakes as there are things that cannot be guessed by
-the generator (e.g.  dependencies on any of the python core modules
-such as BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON_ZLIB).  Also, please take note that the
-license and license files are guessed and must be checked. You also
-need to manually add the package to the +package/Config.in+ file.
-
-If your Buildroot package is not in the official Buildroot tree but in
-a br2-external tree, use the -o flag as follows:
-
------------------------
-utils/scanpypi foo bar -o other_package_dir
------------------------
-
-This will generate packages +python-foo+ and +python-bar+ in the
-+other_package_directory+ instead of +package+.
-
-Option +-h+ will list the available options:
-
------------------------
-utils/scanpypi -h
------------------------
-
-[[python-package-cffi-backend]]
-
-==== +python-package+ CFFI backend
-
-C Foreign Function Interface for Python (CFFI) provides a convenient
-and reliable way to call compiled C code from Python using interface
-declarations written in C. Python packages relying on this backend can
-be identified by the appearance of a +cffi+ dependency in the
-+install_requires+ field of their +setup.py+ file.
-
-Such a package should:
-
- * add +python-cffi+ as a runtime dependency in order to install the
-compiled C library wrapper on the target. This is achieved by adding
-+select BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON_CFFI+ to the package +Config.in+.
-
-------------------------
-config BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON_FOO
-        bool "python-foo"
-        select BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON_CFFI # runtime
-------------------------
-
- * add +host-python-cffi+ as a build-time dependency in order to
-cross-compile the C wrapper. This is achieved by adding
-+host-python-cffi+ to the +PYTHON_FOO_DEPENDENCIES+ variable.

-==== Package name, config entry name and makefile variable relationship
-
-In Buildroot, there is some relationship between:
-
-* the _package name_, which is the package directory name (and the
-  name of the +*.mk+ file);
-
-* the config entry name that is declared in the +Config.in+ file;
-
-* the makefile variable prefix.
-
-It is mandatory to maintain consistency between these elements,
-using the following rules:
-
-* the package directory and the +*.mk+ name are the _package name_
-  itself (e.g.: +package/foo-bar_boo/foo-bar_boo.mk+);
-
-* the _make_ target name is the _package name_ itself (e.g.:
-  +foo-bar_boo+);

-[[check-package]]
-==== How to check the coding style
-
-Buildroot provides a script in +utils/check-package+ that checks new or
-changed files for coding style. It is not a complete language validator,
-but it catches many common mistakes. It is meant to run in the actual
-files you created or modified, before creating the patch for submission.
-
-This script can be used for packages, filesystem makefiles, Config.in
-files, etc. It does not check the files defining the package
-infrastructures and some other files containing similar common code.
-
-To use it, run the +check-package+ script, by telling which files you
-created or changed:
-
-----
-$ ./utils/check-package package/new-package/*
-----
-
-If you have the +utils+ directory in your path you can also run:
-
-----
-$ cd package/new-package/
-$ check-package *
-----
-
-The tool can also be used for packages in a br2-external:
-
-----
-$ check-package -b /path/to/br2-ext-tree/package/my-package/*
-----
-
-[[testing-package]]
-==== How to test your package
-
-Once you have added your new package, it is important that you test it
-under various conditions: does it build for all architectures? Does it
-build with the different C libraries? Does it need threads, NPTL? And
-so on...
-
-Buildroot runs http://autobuild.buildroot.org/[autobuilders] which
-continuously test random configurations. However, these only build the
-`master` branch of the git tree, and your new fancy package is not yet
-there.
-
-Buildroot provides a script in +utils/test-pkg+ that uses the same base
-configurations as used by the autobuilders so you can test your package
-in the same conditions.
-
-First, create a config snippet that contains all the necessary options
-needed to enable your package, but without any architecture or toolchain
-option. For example, let's create a config snippet that just enables
-+libcurl+, without any TLS backend:
-
-----
-$ cat libcurl.config
-BR2_PACKAGE_LIBCURL=y
-----
-
-If your package needs more configuration options, you can add them to the
-config snippet. For example, here's how you would test +libcurl+ with
-+openssl+ as a TLS backend and the +curl+ program:
-
-----
-$ cat libcurl.config
-BR2_PACKAGE_LIBCURL=y
-BR2_PACKAGE_LIBCURL_CURL=y
-BR2_PACKAGE_OPENSSL=y
-----
-
-Then run the +test-pkg+ script, by telling it what config snippet to use
-and what package to test:
-
-----
-$ ./utils/test-pkg -c libcurl.config -p libcurl
-----
-
-By default, +test-pkg+ will build your package against a subset of the
-toolchains used by the autobuilders, which has been selected by the
-Buildroot developers as being the most useful and representative
-subset. If you want to test all toolchains, pass the +-a+ option. Note
-that in any case, internal toolchains are excluded as they take too
-long to build.
-
-The output lists all toolchains that are tested and the corresponding
-result (excerpt, results are fake):
-
-----
-$ ./utils/test-pkg -c libcurl.config -p libcurl
-                armv5-ctng-linux-gnueabi [ 1/11]: OK
-              armv7-ctng-linux-gnueabihf [ 2/11]: OK

-                             br-arm-full [ 9/11]: OK
-                    br-arm-full-nothread [10/11]: FAILED
-                      br-arm-full-static [11/11]: OK
-11 builds, 2 skipped, 2 build failed, 1 legal-info failed
-----
-
-The results mean:
-
-* `OK`: the build was successful.
-* `SKIPPED`: one or more configuration options listed in the config
-  snippet were not present in the final configuration. This is due to
-  options having dependencies not satisfied by the toolchain, such as
-  for example a package that +depends on BR2_USE_MMU+ with a noMMU
-  toolchain. The missing options are reported in +missing.config+ in
-  the output build directory (+~/br-test-pkg/TOOLCHAIN_NAME/+ by
-  default).
-* `FAILED`: the build failed. Inspect the +logfile+ file in the output
-  build  directory to see what went wrong:
-** the actual build failed,
-** the legal-info failed,
-** one of the preliminary steps (downloading the config file, applying
-   the configuration, running `dirclean` for the package) failed.
-
-When there are failures, you can just re-run the script with the same
-options (after you fixed your package); the script will attempt to
-re-build the package specified with +-p+ for all toolchains, without
-the need to re-build all the dependencies of that package.
-
-The +test-pkg+ script accepts a few options, for which you can get some
-help by running:
-
-----
-$ ./utils/test-pkg -h

-[[github-download-url]]
-==== How to add a package from GitHub
-
-Packages on GitHub often don't have a download area with release tarballs.
-However, it is possible to download tarballs directly from the repository
-on GitHub. As GitHub is known to have changed download mechanisms in the
-past, the 'github' helper function should be used as shown below.
-
-------------------------
-# Use a tag or a full commit ID
-FOO_VERSION = 1.0
-FOO_SITE = $(call github,<user>,<package>,v$(FOO_VERSION))
-------------------------
-
-.Notes
-- The FOO_VERSION can either be a tag or a commit ID.
-- The tarball name generated by github matches the default one from
-  Buildroot (e.g.: +foo-f6fb6654af62045239caed5950bc6c7971965e60.tar.gz+),
-  so it is not necessary to specify it in the +.mk+ file.
-- When using a commit ID as version, you should use the full 40 hex characters.
-- When the tag contains a prefix such as +v+ in +v1.0+, then the
-  +VERSION+ variable should contain just +1.0+, and the +v+ should be
-  added directly in the +SITE+ variable, as illustrated above. This
-  ensures that the +VERSION+ variable value can be used to match
-  against http://www.release-monitoring.org/[release-monitoring.org]
-  results.
-
-If the package you wish to add does have a release section on GitHub, the
-maintainer may have uploaded a release tarball, or the release may just point
-to the automatically generated tarball from the git tag. If there is a
-release tarball uploaded by the maintainer, we prefer to use that since it
-may be slightly different (e.g. it contains a configure script so we don't
-need to do AUTORECONF).
-
-You can see on the release page if it's an uploaded tarball or a git tag:
-
-image::github_hash_mongrel2.png[]
-
-- If it looks like the image above then it was uploaded by the
-  maintainer and you should use that link (in that example:
-  'mongrel2-v1.9.2.tar.bz2') to specify +FOO_SITE+, and not use the
-  'github' helper.
-
-- On the other hand, if there's is *only* the "Source code" link, then
-  it's an automatically generated tarball and you should use the
-  'github' helper function.
-
-[[gitlab-download-url]]
-==== How to add a package from Gitlab
-
-In a similar way to the +github+ macro described in
-xref:github-download-url[], Buildroot also provides the +gitlab+ macro
-to download from Gitlab repositories. It can be used to download
-auto-generated tarballs produced by Gitlab, either for specific tags
-or commits:
-
-------------------------
-# Use a tag or a full commit ID
-FOO_VERSION = 1.0
-FOO_SITE = $(call gitlab,<user>,<package>,v$(FOO_VERSION))
-------------------------
-
-By default, it will use a +.tar.gz+ tarball, but Gitlab also provides
-+.tar.bz2+ tarballs, so by adding a +<pkg>_SOURCE+ variable, this
-+.tar.bz2+ tarball can be used:
-
-------------------------
-# Use a tag or a full commit ID
-FOO_VERSION = 1.0
-FOO_SITE = $(call gitlab,<user>,<package>,v$(FOO_VERSION))
-FOO_SOURCE = foo-$(FOO_VERSION).tar.bz2
-------------------------
-
-If there is a specific tarball uploaded by the upstream developers in
-+https://gitlab.com/<project>/releases/+, do not use this macro, but
-rather use directly the link to the tarball.

-=== Infrastructure for virtual packages
-
-[[virtual-package-tutorial]]
-
-In Buildroot, a virtual package is a package whose functionalities are
-provided by one or more packages, referred to as 'providers'. The virtual
-package management is an extensible mechanism allowing the user to choose
-the provider used in the rootfs.
-
-For example, 'OpenGL ES' is an API for 2D and 3D graphics on embedded systems.
-The implementation of this API is different for the 'Allwinner Tech Sunxi' and
-the 'Texas Instruments OMAP35xx' platforms. So +libgles+ will be a virtual
-package and +sunxi-mali+ and +ti-gfx+ will be the providers.
-
-==== +virtual-package+ tutorial
-
-In the following example, we will explain how to add a new virtual package
-('something-virtual') and a provider for it ('some-provider').
-
-First, let's create the virtual package.
-
-==== Virtual package's +Config.in+ file
-
-The +Config.in+ file of virtual package 'something-virtual' should contain:
-
----------------------------
-01: config BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_SOMETHING_VIRTUAL
-02:	bool
-03:
-04: config BR2_PACKAGE_PROVIDES_SOMETHING_VIRTUAL
-05:	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_SOMETHING_VIRTUAL
-06:	string
----------------------------
-
-In this file, we declare two options, +BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_SOMETHING_VIRTUAL+ and
-+BR2_PACKAGE_PROVIDES_SOMETHING_VIRTUAL+, whose values will be used by the
-providers.
-
-==== Virtual package's +.mk+ file
-
-The +.mk+ for the virtual package should just evaluate the +virtual-package+ macro:
-
----------------------------
-01: ################################################################################
-02: #
-03: # something-virtual
-04: #
-05: ################################################################################
-06:
-07: $(eval $(virtual-package))
----------------------------
-
-The ability to have target and host packages is also available, with the
-+host-virtual-package+ macro.
-
-==== Provider's +Config.in+ file
-
-When adding a package as a provider, only the +Config.in+ file requires some
-modifications.
-
-The +Config.in+ file of the package 'some-provider', which provides the
-functionalities of 'something-virtual', should contain:
-
----------------------------
-01: config BR2_PACKAGE_SOME_PROVIDER
-02:	bool "some-provider"
-03:	select BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_SOMETHING_VIRTUAL
-04:	help
-05:	  This is a comment that explains what some-provider is.
-06:
-07:	  http://foosoftware.org/some-provider/
-08:
-09: if BR2_PACKAGE_SOME_PROVIDER
-10: config BR2_PACKAGE_PROVIDES_SOMETHING_VIRTUAL
-11:	default "some-provider"
-12: endif
----------------------------
-
-On line 3, we select +BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_SOMETHING_VIRTUAL+, and on line 11, we
-set the value of +BR2_PACKAGE_PROVIDES_SOMETHING_VIRTUAL+ to the name of the
-provider, but only if it is selected.
-
-==== Provider's +.mk+ file
-
-The +.mk+ file should also declare an additional variable
-+SOME_PROVIDER_PROVIDES+ to contain the names of all the virtual
-packages it is an implementation of:
-
----------------------------
-01: SOME_PROVIDER_PROVIDES = something-virtual
----------------------------
-
-Of course, do not forget to add the proper build and runtime dependencies for
-this package!
-
-==== Notes on depending on a virtual package
-
-When adding a package that requires a certain +FEATURE+ provided by a virtual
-package, you have to use +depends on BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_FEATURE+, like so:
-
----------------------------
-config BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_FEATURE
-    bool
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_FOO
-    bool "foo"
-    depends on BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_FEATURE
----------------------------
-
-==== Notes on depending on a specific provider
-
-If your package really requires a specific provider, then you'll have to
-make your package +depends on+ this provider; you can _not_ +select+ a
-provider.
-
-Let's take an example with two providers for a +FEATURE+:
-
----------------------------
-config BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_FEATURE
-    bool
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_FOO
-    bool "foo"
-    select BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_FEATURE
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_BAR
-    bool "bar"
-    select BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_FEATURE
----------------------------
-
-And you are adding a package that needs +FEATURE+ as provided by +foo+,
-but not as provided by +bar+.
-
-If you were to use +select BR2_PACKAGE_FOO+, then the user would still
-be able to select +BR2_PACKAGE_BAR+ in the menuconfig. This would create
-a configuration inconsistency, whereby two providers of the same +FEATURE+
-would be enabled at once, one explicitly set by the user, the other
-implicitly by your +select+.
-
-Instead, you have to use +depends on BR2_PACKAGE_FOO+, which avoids any
-implicit configuration inconsistency.

-=== Infrastructure for Waf-based packages
-
-[[waf-package-tutorial]]
-
-==== +waf-package+ tutorial
-
-First, let's see how to write a +.mk+ file for a Waf-based package, with
-an example :
-
-------------------------
-01: ################################################################################
-02: #
-03: # libfoo
-04: #
-05: ################################################################################
-06:
-07: LIBFOO_VERSION = 1.0
-08: LIBFOO_SOURCE = libfoo-$(LIBFOO_VERSION).tar.gz
-09: LIBFOO_SITE = http://www.foosoftware.org/download
-10: LIBFOO_CONF_OPTS = --enable-bar --disable-baz
-11: LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES = bar
-12:
-13: $(eval $(waf-package))
-------------------------
-
-On line 7, we declare the version of the package.
-
-On line 8 and 9, we declare the name of the tarball (xz-ed tarball
-recommended) and the location of the tarball on the Web. Buildroot
-will automatically download the tarball from this location.
-
-On line 10, we tell Buildroot what options to enable for libfoo.
-
-On line 11, we tell Buildroot the dependencies of libfoo.
-
-Finally, on line line 13, we invoke the +waf-package+
-macro that generates all the Makefile rules that actually allows the
-package to be built.
-
-[[waf-package-reference]]
-
-==== +waf-package+ reference
-
-The main macro of the Waf package infrastructure is +waf-package+.
-It is similar to the +generic-package+ macro.
-
-Just like the generic infrastructure, the Waf infrastructure works
-by defining a number of variables before calling the +waf-package+
-macro.
-
-First, all the package metadata information variables that exist in
-the generic infrastructure also exist in the Waf infrastructure:
-+LIBFOO_VERSION+, +LIBFOO_SOURCE+, +LIBFOO_PATCH+, +LIBFOO_SITE+,
-+LIBFOO_SUBDIR+, +LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES+, +LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING+,
-+LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET+.
-
-An additional variable, specific to the Waf infrastructure, can
-also be defined.
-
-* +LIBFOO_SUBDIR+ may contain the name of a subdirectory inside the
-  package that contains the main wscript file. This is useful,
-  if for example, the main wscript file is not at the root of
-  the tree extracted by the tarball. If +HOST_LIBFOO_SUBDIR+ is not
-  specified, it defaults to +LIBFOO_SUBDIR+.
-
-* +LIBFOO_NEEDS_EXTERNAL_WAF+ can be set to +YES+ or +NO+ to tell
-  Buildroot to use the bundled +waf+ executable. If set to +NO+, the
-  default, then Buildroot will use the waf executable provided in the
-  package source tree; if set to +YES+, then Buildroot will download,
-  install waf as a host tool and use it to build the package.
-
-* +LIBFOO_WAF_OPTS+, to specify additional options to pass to the
-  +waf+ script at every step of the package build process: configure,
-  build and installation. By default, empty.
-
-* +LIBFOO_CONF_OPTS+, to specify additional options to pass to the
-  +waf+ script for the configuration step. By default, empty.
-
-* +LIBFOO_BUILD_OPTS+, to specify additional options to pass to the
-  +waf+ script during the build step. By default, empty.
-
-* +LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_OPTS+, to specify additional options to pass
-  to the +waf+ script during the staging installation step.  By default,
-  empty.
-
-* +LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET_OPTS+, to specify additional options to pass
-  to the +waf+ script during the target installation step.  By default,
-  empty.

-== Beyond Buildroot
-
-=== Boot the generated images
-
-==== NFS boot
-
-To achieve NFS-boot, enable _tar root filesystem_ in the _Filesystem
-images_ menu.
-
-After a complete build, just run the following commands to setup the
-NFS-root directory:
-
--------------------
-sudo tar -xavf /path/to/output_dir/rootfs.tar -C /path/to/nfs_root_dir
--------------------
-
-Remember to add this path to +/etc/exports+.
-
-Then, you can execute a NFS-boot from your target.
-
-==== Live CD
-
-To build a live CD image, enable the _iso image_ option in the
-_Filesystem images_ menu. Note that this option is only available on
-the x86 and x86-64 architectures, and if you are building your kernel
-with Buildroot.
-
-You can build a live CD image with either IsoLinux, Grub or Grub 2 as
-a bootloader, but only Isolinux supports making this image usable both
-as a live CD and live USB (through the _Build hybrid image_ option).
-
-You can test your live CD image using QEMU:
-
--------------------
-qemu-system-i386 -cdrom output/images/rootfs.iso9660
--------------------
-
-Or use it as a hard-drive image if it is a hybrid ISO:
-
--------------------
-qemu-system-i386 -hda output/images/rootfs.iso9660
--------------------
-
-It can be easily flashed to a USB drive with +dd+:
-
--------------------
-dd if=output/images/rootfs.iso9660 of=/dev/sdb
--------------------
-
-=== Chroot
-
-If you want to chroot in a generated image, then there are few thing
-you should be aware of:
-
-* you should setup the new root from the _tar root filesystem_ image;
-
-* either the selected target architecture is compatible with your host
-  machine, or you should use some +qemu-*+ binary and correctly set it
-  within the +binfmt+ properties to be able to run the binaries built
-  for the target on your host machine;
-
-* Buildroot does not currently provide +host-qemu+ and +binfmt+
-  correctly built and set for that kind of use.

-[[ccache]]
-==== Using +ccache+ in Buildroot
-
-http://ccache.samba.org[ccache] is a compiler cache. It stores the
-object files resulting from each compilation process, and is able to
-skip future compilation of the same source file (with same compiler
-and same arguments) by using the pre-existing object files. When doing
-almost identical builds from scratch a number of times, it can nicely
-speed up the build process.
-
-+ccache+ support is integrated in Buildroot. You just have to enable
-+Enable compiler cache+ in +Build options+. This will automatically
-build +ccache+ and use it for every host and target compilation.
-
-The cache is located in +$HOME/.buildroot-ccache+. It is stored
-outside of Buildroot output directory so that it can be shared by
-separate Buildroot builds. If you want to get rid of the cache, simply
-remove this directory.
-
-You can get statistics on the cache (its size, number of hits,
-misses, etc.) by running +make ccache-stats+.
-
-The make target +ccache-options+ and the +CCACHE_OPTIONS+ variable
-provide more generic access to the ccache. For example
-
------------------
-# set cache limit size
-make CCACHE_OPTIONS="--max-size=5G" ccache-options
-
-# zero statistics counters
-make CCACHE_OPTIONS="--zero-stats" ccache-options
------------------
-
-+ccache+ makes a hash of the source files and of the compiler options.
-If a compiler option is different, the cached object file will not be
-used. Many compiler options, however, contain an absolute path to the
-staging directory. Because of this, building in a different output
-directory would lead to many cache misses.
-
-To avoid this issue, buildroot has the +Use relative paths+ option
-(+BR2_CCACHE_USE_BASEDIR+). This will rewrite all absolute paths that
-point inside the output directory into relative paths. Thus, changing
-the output directory no longer leads to cache misses.
-
-A disadvantage of the relative paths is that they also end up to be
-relative paths in the object file. Therefore, for example, the debugger
-will no longer find the file, unless you cd to the output directory
-first.
-
-See https://ccache.samba.org/manual.html#_compiling_in_different_directories[the
-ccache manual's section on "Compiling in different directories"] for
-more details about this rewriting of absolute paths.

-== General Buildroot usage
-
-include::make-tips.txt[]
-
-include::rebuilding-packages.txt[]
-
-=== Offline builds
-
-If you intend to do an offline build and just want to download
-all sources that you previously selected in the configurator
-('menuconfig', 'nconfig', 'xconfig' or 'gconfig'), then issue:
-
---------------------
- $ make source
---------------------
-
-You can now disconnect or copy the content of your +dl+
-directory to the build-host.
-
-=== Building out-of-tree
-
-As default, everything built by Buildroot is stored in the directory
-+output+ in the Buildroot tree.
-
-Buildroot also supports building out of tree with a syntax similar to
-the Linux kernel. To use it, add +O=<directory>+ to the make command
-line:
-
---------------------
- $ make O=/tmp/build
---------------------
-
-Or:
-
---------------------
- $ cd /tmp/build; make O=$PWD -C path/to/buildroot
---------------------
-
-All the output files will be located under +/tmp/build+. If the +O+
-path does not exist, Buildroot will create it.
-
-*Note:* the +O+ path can be either an absolute or a relative path, but if it's
-passed as a relative path, it is important to note that it is interpreted
-relative to the main Buildroot source directory, *not* the current working
-directory.
-
-When using out-of-tree builds, the Buildroot +.config+ and temporary
-files are also stored in the output directory. This means that you can
-safely run multiple builds in parallel using the same source tree as
-long as they use unique output directories.
-
-For ease of use, Buildroot generates a Makefile wrapper in the output
-directory - so after the first run, you no longer need to pass +O=<...>+
-and +-C <...>+, simply run (in the output directory):
-
---------------------
- $ make <target>
---------------------
-
-[[env-vars]]
-
-=== Environment variables
-
-Buildroot also honors some environment variables, when they are passed
-to +make+ or set in the environment:
-
-* +HOSTCXX+, the host C++ compiler to use
-* +HOSTCC+, the host C compiler to use
-* +UCLIBC_CONFIG_FILE=<path/to/.config>+, path to
-  the uClibc configuration file, used to compile uClibc, if an
-  internal toolchain is being built.
-  +
-  Note that the uClibc configuration file can also be set from the
-  configuration interface, so through the Buildroot +.config+ file; this
-  is the recommended way of setting it.
-  +
-* +BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FILE=<path/to/.config>+, path to
-  the BusyBox configuration file.
-  +
-  Note that the BusyBox configuration file can also be set from the
-  configuration interface, so through the Buildroot +.config+ file; this
-  is the recommended way of setting it.
-  +
-* +BR2_CCACHE_DIR+ to override the directory where
-  Buildroot stores the cached files when using ccache.
-  +
-* +BR2_DL_DIR+ to override the directory in which
-  Buildroot stores/retrieves downloaded files.
-  +
-  Note that the Buildroot download directory can also be set from the
-  configuration interface, so through the Buildroot +.config+ file. See
-  xref:download-location[] for more details on how you can set the download
-  directory.
-* +BR2_GRAPH_ALT+, if set and non-empty, to use an alternate color-scheme in
-  build-time graphs
-* +BR2_GRAPH_OUT+ to set the filetype of generated graphs, either +pdf+ (the
-  default), or +png+.
-* +BR2_GRAPH_DEPS_OPTS+ to pass extra options to the dependency graph; see
-  xref:graph-depends[] for the accepted options
-* +BR2_GRAPH_DOT_OPTS+ is passed verbatim as options to the +dot+ utility to
-  draw the dependency graph.
-* +BR2_GRAPH_SIZE_OPTS+ to pass extra options to the size graph; see
-  xref:graph-size[] for the acepted options
-
-An example that uses config files located in the toplevel directory and
-in your $HOME:
-
---------------------
- $ make UCLIBC_CONFIG_FILE=uClibc.config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FILE=$HOME/bb.config
---------------------
-
-If you want to use a compiler other than the default +gcc+
-or +g+++ for building helper-binaries on your host, then do
-
---------------------
- $ make HOSTCXX=g++-4.3-HEAD HOSTCC=gcc-4.3-HEAD
---------------------
-
-=== Dealing efficiently with filesystem images
-
-Filesystem images can get pretty big, depending on the filesystem you choose,
-the number of packages, whether you provisioned free space... Yet, some
-locations in the filesystems images may just be _empty_ (e.g. a long run of
-'zeroes'); such a file is called a _sparse_ file.
-
-Most tools can handle sparse files efficiently, and will only store or write
-those parts of a sparse file that are not empty.
-
-For example:
-
-* +tar+ accepts the +-S+ option to tell it to only store non-zero blocks
-  of sparse files:
-** +tar cf archive.tar -S [files...]+ will efficiently store sparse files
-   in a tarball
-** +tar xf archive.tar -S+ will efficiently store sparse files extracted
-   from a tarball
-
-* +cp+ accepts the +--sparse=WHEN+ option (+WHEN+ is one of +auto+,
-  +never+ or +always+):
-** +cp --sparse=always source.file dest.file+ will make +dest.file+ a
-   sparse file if +source.file+ has long runs of zeroes
-
-Other tools may have similar options. Please consult their respective man
-pages.
-
-You can use sparse files if you need to store the filesystem images (e.g.
-to transfer from one machine to another), or if you need to send them (e.g.
-to the Q&A team).
-
-Note however that flashing a filesystem image to a device while using the
-sparse mode of +dd+ may result in a broken filesystem (e.g. the block bitmap
-of an ext2 filesystem may be corrupted; or, if you have sparse files in
-your filesystem, those parts may not be all-zeroes when read back). You
-should only use sparse files when handling files on the build machine, not
-when transferring them to an actual device that will be used on the target.
-
-=== Details about packages
-
-[[package-details]]
-
-Buildroot can produce a JSON blurb that describes the set of enabled
-packages in the current configuration, together with their
-dependencies, licenses and other metadata. This JSON blurb is produced
-by using the +show-info+ make target:
-
-------------------------
-make show-info
-------------------------
-
-Buildroot can also produce details about packages as HTML and JSON
-output using the +pkg-stats+ make target. Amongst other things, these
-details include whether known CVEs (security vulnerabilities) affect
-the packages in your current configuration. It also shows if there is
-a newer upstream version for those packages.
-
-------------------------
-make pkg-stats
-------------------------
-
-=== Graphing the dependencies between packages
-
-[[graph-depends]]
-
-One of Buildroot's jobs is to know the dependencies between packages,
-and make sure they are built in the right order. These dependencies
-can sometimes be quite complicated, and for a given system, it is
-often not easy to understand why such or such package was brought into
-the build by Buildroot.
-
-In order to help understanding the dependencies, and therefore better
-understand what is the role of the different components in your
-embedded Linux system, Buildroot is capable of generating dependency
-graphs.
-
-To generate a dependency graph of the full system you have compiled,
-simply run:
-
-------------------------
-make graph-depends
-------------------------
-
-You will find the generated graph in
-+output/graphs/graph-depends.pdf+.
-
-If your system is quite large, the dependency graph may be too complex
-and difficult to read. It is therefore possible to generate the
-dependency graph just for a given package:
-
-------------------------
-make <pkg>-graph-depends
-------------------------
-
-You will find the generated graph in
-+output/graph/<pkg>-graph-depends.pdf+.
-
-Note that the dependency graphs are generated using the +dot+ tool
-from the _Graphviz_ project, which you must have installed on your
-system to use this feature. In most distributions, it is available as
-the +graphviz+ package.
-
-By default, the dependency graphs are generated in the PDF
-format. However, by passing the +BR2_GRAPH_OUT+ environment variable, you
-can switch to other output formats, such as PNG, PostScript or
-SVG. All formats supported by the +-T+ option of the +dot+ tool are
-supported.
-
---------------------------------
-BR2_GRAPH_OUT=svg make graph-depends
---------------------------------
-
-The +graph-depends+ behaviour can be controlled by setting options in the
-+BR2_GRAPH_DEPS_OPTS+ environment variable. The accepted options are:
-
-* +--depth N+, +-d N+, to limit the dependency depth to +N+ levels. The
-  default, +0+, means no limit.
-
-* +--stop-on PKG+, +-s PKG+, to stop the graph on the package +PKG+.
-  +PKG+ can be an actual package name, a glob, the keyword 'virtual'
-  (to stop on virtual packages), or the keyword 'host' (to stop on
-  host packages). The package is still present on the graph, but its
-  dependencies are not.
-
-* +--exclude PKG+, +-x PKG+, like +--stop-on+, but also omits +PKG+ from
-  the graph.
-
-* +--transitive+, +--no-transitive+, to draw (or not) the transitive
-  dependencies. The default is to not draw transitive dependencies.
-
-* +--colors R,T,H+, the comma-separated list of colors to draw the
-  root package (+R+), the target packages (+T+) and the host packages
-  (+H+). Defaults to: +lightblue,grey,gainsboro+
-
---------------------------------
-BR2_GRAPH_DEPS_OPTS='-d 3 --no-transitive --colors=red,green,blue' make graph-depends
---------------------------------
-
-=== Graphing the build duration
-
-[[graph-duration]]
-
-When the build of a system takes a long time, it is sometimes useful
-to be able to understand which packages are the longest to build, to
-see if anything can be done to speed up the build. In order to help
-such build time analysis, Buildroot collects the build time of each
-step of each package, and allows to generate graphs from this data.
-
-To generate the build time graph after a build, run:
-
-----------------
-make graph-build
-----------------
-
-This will generate a set of files in +output/graphs+ :
-
-* +build.hist-build.pdf+, a histogram of the build time for each
-  package, ordered in the build order.
-
-* +build.hist-duration.pdf+, a histogram of the build time for each
-  package, ordered by duration (longest first)
-
-* +build.hist-name.pdf+, a histogram of the build time for each
-  package, order by package name.
-
-* +build.pie-packages.pdf+, a pie chart of the build time per package
-
-* +build.pie-steps.pdf+, a pie chart of the global time spent in each
-  step of the packages build process.
-
-This +graph-build+ target requires the Python Matplotlib and Numpy
-libraries to be installed (+python-matplotlib+ and +python-numpy+ on
-most distributions), and also the +argparse+ module if you're using a
-Python version older than 2.7 (+python-argparse+ on most
-distributions).
-
-By default, the output format for the graph is PDF, but a different
-format can be selected using the +BR2_GRAPH_OUT+ environment variable. The
-only other format supported is PNG:
-
-----------------
-BR2_GRAPH_OUT=png make graph-build
-----------------
-
-[[graph-size]]
-=== Graphing the filesystem size contribution of packages
-
-When your target system grows, it is sometimes useful to understand
-how much each Buildroot package is contributing to the overall root
-filesystem size. To help with such an analysis, Buildroot collects
-data about files installed by each package and using this data,
-generates a graph and CSV files detailing the size contribution of
-the different packages.
-
-To generate these data after a build, run:
-
-----------------
-make graph-size
-----------------
-
-This will generate:
-
-* +output/graphs/graph-size.pdf+, a pie chart of the contribution of
-  each package to the overall root filesystem size
-
-* +output/graphs/package-size-stats.csv+, a CSV file giving the size
-  contribution of each package to the overall root filesystem size
-
-* +output/graphs/file-size-stats.csv+, a CSV file giving the size
-  contribution of each installed file to the package it belongs, and
-  to the overall filesystem size.
-
-This +graph-size+ target requires the Python Matplotlib library to be
-installed (+python-matplotlib+ on most distributions), and also the
-+argparse+ module if you're using a Python version older than 2.7
-(+python-argparse+ on most distributions).
-
-Just like for the duration graph, a +BR2_GRAPH_OUT+ environment variable
-is supported to adjust the output file format. See xref:graph-depends[]
-for details about this environment variable.
-
-Additionally, one may set the environment variable +BR2_GRAPH_SIZE_OPTS+
-to further control the generated graph. Accepted options are:
-
-* `--size-limit X`, `-l X`, will group all packages which individual
-  contribution is below `X` percent, to a single entry labelled _Others_
-  in the graph. By default, `X=0.01`, which means packages each
-  contributing less than 1% are grouped under _Others_. Accepted values
-  are in the range `[0.0..1.0]`.
-
-* `--iec`, `--binary`, `--si`, `--decimal`, to use IEC (binary, powers
-  of 1024) or SI (decimal, powers of 1000; the default) prefixes.
-
-* `--biggest-first`, to sort packages in decreasing size order, rather
-  than in increasing size order.
-
-.Note
-The collected filesystem size data is only meaningful after a complete
-clean rebuild. Be sure to run +make clean all+ before using +make
-graph-size+.
-
-To compare the root filesystem size of two different Buildroot compilations,
-for example after adjusting the configuration or when switching to another
-Buildroot release, use the +size-stats-compare+ script. It takes two
-+file-size-stats.csv+ files (produced by +make graph-size+) as input.
-Refer to the help text of this script for more details:
-
-----------------
-utils/size-stats-compare -h
-----------------
-
-[[top-level-parallel-build]]
-=== Top-level parallel build
-
-.Note
-This section deals with a very experimental feature, which is known to
-break even in some non-unusual situations. Use at your own risk.
-
-Buildroot has always been capable of using parallel build on a per
-package basis: each package is built by Buildroot using +make -jN+ (or
-the equivalent invocation for non-make-based build systems). The level
-of parallelism is by default number of CPUs + 1, but it can be
-adjusted using the +BR2_JLEVEL+ configuration option.
-
-Until 2020.02, Buildroot was however building packages in a serial
-fashion: each package was built one after the other, without
-parallelization of the build between packages. As of 2020.02,
-Buildroot has experimental support for *top-level parallel build*,
-which allows some signicant build time savings by building packages
-that have no dependency relationship in parallel. This feature is
-however marked as experimental and is known not to work in some cases.
-
-In order to use top-level parallel build, one must:
-
-. Enable the option +BR2_PER_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES+ in the Buildroot
-configuration
-
-. Use +make -jN+ when starting the Buildroot build
-
-Internally, the +BR2_PER_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES+ will enable a mechanism
-called *per-package directories*, which will have the following
-effects:
-
-* Instead of a global _target_ directory and a global _host_ directory
-  common to all packages, per-package _target_ and _host_ directories
-  will be used, in +$(O)/per-package/<pkg>/target/+ and
-  +$(O)/per-package/<pkg>/host/+ respectively. Those folders will be
-  populated from the corresponding folders of the package dependencies
-  at the beginning of +<pkg>+ build. The compiler and all other tools
-  will therefore only be able to see and access files installed by
-  dependencies explicitly listed by +<pkg>+.
-
-* At the end of the build, the global _target_ and _host_ directories
-  will be populated, located in +$(O)/target+ and +$(O)/host+
-  respectively. This means that during the build, those folders will
-  be empty and it's only at the very end of the build that they will
-  be populated.

-
-=== Cross-compilation toolchain
-
-A compilation toolchain is the set of tools that allows you to compile
-code for your system. It consists of a compiler (in our case, +gcc+),
-binary utils like assembler and linker (in our case, +binutils+) and a
-C standard library (for example
-http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html[GNU Libc],
-http://www.uclibc-ng.org/[uClibc-ng]).
-
-The system installed on your development station certainly already has
-a compilation toolchain that you can use to compile an application
-that runs on your system. If you're using a PC, your compilation
-toolchain runs on an x86 processor and generates code for an x86
-processor. Under most Linux systems, the compilation toolchain uses
-the GNU libc (glibc) as the C standard library. This compilation
-toolchain is called the "host compilation toolchain". The machine on
-which it is running, and on which you're working, is called the "host
-system" footnote:[This terminology differs from what is used by GNU
-configure, where the host is the machine on which the application will
-run (which is usually the same as target)].
-
-The compilation toolchain is provided by your distribution, and
-Buildroot has nothing to do with it (other than using it to build a
-cross-compilation toolchain and other tools that are run on the
-development host).
-
-As said above, the compilation toolchain that comes with your system
-runs on and generates code for the processor in your host system. As
-your embedded system has a different processor, you need a
-cross-compilation toolchain - a compilation toolchain that runs on
-your _host system_ but generates code for your _target system_ (and
-target processor). For example, if your host system uses x86 and your
-target system uses ARM, the regular compilation toolchain on your host
-runs on x86 and generates code for x86, while the cross-compilation
-toolchain runs on x86 and generates code for ARM.
-
-Buildroot provides two solutions for the cross-compilation toolchain:
-
- * The *internal toolchain backend*, called +Buildroot toolchain+ in
-   the configuration interface.
-
- * The *external toolchain backend*, called +External toolchain+ in
-   the configuration interface.
-
-The choice between these two solutions is done using the +Toolchain
-Type+ option in the +Toolchain+ menu. Once one solution has been
-chosen, a number of configuration options appear, they are detailed in
-the following sections.
-
-[[internal-toolchain-backend]]
-==== Internal toolchain backend
-
-The _internal toolchain backend_ is the backend where Buildroot builds
-by itself a cross-compilation toolchain, before building the userspace
-applications and libraries for your target embedded system.
-
-This backend supports several C libraries:
-http://www.uclibc-ng.org[uClibc-ng],
-http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html[glibc] and
-http://www.musl-libc.org[musl].
-
-Once you have selected this backend, a number of options appear. The
-most important ones allow to:
-
- * Change the version of the Linux kernel headers used to build the
-   toolchain. This item deserves a few explanations. In the process of
-   building a cross-compilation toolchain, the C library is being
-   built. This library provides the interface between userspace
-   applications and the Linux kernel. In order to know how to "talk"
-   to the Linux kernel, the C library needs to have access to the
-   _Linux kernel headers_ (i.e. the +.h+ files from the kernel), which
-   define the interface between userspace and the kernel (system
-   calls, data structures, etc.). Since this interface is backward
-   compatible, the version of the Linux kernel headers used to build
-   your toolchain do not need to match _exactly_ the version of the
-   Linux kernel you intend to run on your embedded system. They only
-   need to have a version equal or older to the version of the Linux
-   kernel you intend to run. If you use kernel headers that are more
-   recent than the Linux kernel you run on your embedded system, then
-   the C library might be using interfaces that are not provided by
-   your Linux kernel.
-
- * Change the version of the GCC compiler, binutils and the C library.
-
- * Select a number of toolchain options (uClibc only): whether the
-   toolchain should have RPC support (used mainly for NFS),
-   wide-char support, locale support (for internationalization),
-   C++ support or thread support. Depending on which options you choose,
-   the number of userspace applications and libraries visible in
-   Buildroot menus will change: many applications and libraries require
-   certain toolchain options to be enabled. Most packages show a comment
-   when a certain toolchain option is required to be able to enable
-   those packages. If needed, you can further refine the uClibc
-   configuration by running +make uclibc-menuconfig+. Note however that
-   all packages in Buildroot are tested against the default uClibc
-   configuration bundled in Buildroot: if you deviate from this
-   configuration by removing features from uClibc, some packages may no
-   longer build.
-
-It is worth noting that whenever one of those options is modified,
-then the entire toolchain and system must be rebuilt. See
-xref:full-rebuild[].
-
-Advantages of this backend:
-
-* Well integrated with Buildroot
-* Fast, only builds what's necessary
-
-Drawbacks of this backend:
-
-* Rebuilding the toolchain is needed when doing +make clean+, which
-  takes time. If you're trying to reduce your build time, consider
-  using the _External toolchain backend_.
-
-[[external-toolchain-backend]]
-==== External toolchain backend
-
-The _external toolchain backend_ allows to use existing pre-built
-cross-compilation toolchains. Buildroot knows about a number of
-well-known cross-compilation toolchains (from
-http://www.linaro.org[Linaro] for ARM,
-http://www.mentor.com/embedded-software/sourcery-tools/sourcery-codebench/editions/lite-edition/[Sourcery
-CodeBench] for ARM, x86-64, PowerPC, and MIPS, and is capable of
-downloading them automatically, or it can be pointed to a custom
-toolchain, either available for download or installed locally.
-
-Then, you have three solutions to use an external toolchain:
-
-* Use a predefined external toolchain profile, and let Buildroot
-  download, extract and install the toolchain. Buildroot already knows
-  about a few CodeSourcery and Linaro toolchains. Just select the
-  toolchain profile in +Toolchain+ from the available ones. This is
-  definitely the easiest solution.
-
-* Use a predefined external toolchain profile, but instead of having
-  Buildroot download and extract the toolchain, you can tell Buildroot
-  where your toolchain is already installed on your system. Just
-  select the toolchain profile in +Toolchain+ through the available
-  ones, unselect +Download toolchain automatically+, and fill the
-  +Toolchain path+ text entry with the path to your cross-compiling
-  toolchain.
-
-* Use a completely custom external toolchain. This is particularly
-  useful for toolchains generated using crosstool-NG or with Buildroot
-  itself. To do this, select the +Custom toolchain+ solution in the
-  +Toolchain+ list. You need to fill the +Toolchain path+, +Toolchain
-  prefix+ and +External toolchain C library+ options. Then, you have
-  to tell Buildroot what your external toolchain supports. If your
-  external toolchain uses the 'glibc' library, you only have to tell
-  whether your toolchain supports C\++ or not and whether it has
-  built-in RPC support. If your external toolchain uses the 'uClibc'
-  library, then you have to tell Buildroot if it supports RPC,
-  wide-char, locale, program invocation, threads and C++.
-  At the beginning of the execution, Buildroot will tell you if
-  the selected options do not match the toolchain configuration.
-
-Our external toolchain support has been tested with toolchains from
-CodeSourcery and Linaro, toolchains generated by
-http://crosstool-ng.org[crosstool-NG], and toolchains generated by
-Buildroot itself. In general, all toolchains that support the
-'sysroot' feature should work. If not, do not hesitate to contact the
-developers.
-
-We do not support toolchains or SDK generated by OpenEmbedded or
-Yocto, because these toolchains are not pure toolchains (i.e. just the
-compiler, binutils, the C and C++ libraries). Instead these toolchains
-come with a very large set of pre-compiled libraries and
-programs. Therefore, Buildroot cannot import the 'sysroot' of the
-toolchain, as it would contain hundreds of megabytes of pre-compiled
-libraries that are normally built by Buildroot.
-
-We also do not support using the distribution toolchain (i.e. the
-gcc/binutils/C library installed by your distribution) as the
-toolchain to build software for the target. This is because your
-distribution toolchain is not a "pure" toolchain (i.e. only with the
-C/C++ library), so we cannot import it properly into the Buildroot
-build environment. So even if you are building a system for a x86 or
-x86_64 target, you have to generate a cross-compilation toolchain with
-Buildroot or crosstool-NG.
-
-If you want to generate a custom toolchain for your project, that can
-be used as an external toolchain in Buildroot, our recommendation is
-to build it either with Buildroot itself (see
-xref:build-toolchain-with-buildroot[]) or with
-http://crosstool-ng.org[crosstool-NG].
-
-Advantages of this backend:
-
-* Allows to use well-known and well-tested cross-compilation
-  toolchains.
-
-* Avoids the build time of the cross-compilation toolchain, which is
-  often very significant in the overall build time of an embedded
-  Linux system.
-
-Drawbacks of this backend:
-
-* If your pre-built external toolchain has a bug, may be hard to get a
-  fix from the toolchain vendor, unless you build your external
-  toolchain by yourself using Buildroot or Crosstool-NG.
-
-[[build-toolchain-with-buildroot]]
-==== Build an external toolchain with Buildroot
-
-The Buildroot internal toolchain option can be used to create an
-external toolchain. Here are a series of steps to build an internal
-toolchain and package it up for reuse by Buildroot itself (or other
-projects).
-
-Create a new Buildroot configuration, with the following details:
-
-* Select the appropriate *Target options* for your target CPU
-  architecture
-
-* In the *Toolchain* menu, keep the default of *Buildroot toolchain*
-  for *Toolchain type*, and configure your toolchain as desired
-
-* In the *System configuration* menu, select *None* as the *Init
-  system* and *none* as */bin/sh*
-
-* In the *Target packages* menu, disable *BusyBox*
-
-* In the *Filesystem images* menu, disable *tar the root filesystem*
-
-Then, we can trigger the build, and also ask Buildroot to generate a
-SDK. This will conveniently generate for us a tarball which contains
-our toolchain:
-
------
-make sdk
------
-
-This produces the SDK tarball in +$(O)/images+, with a name similar to
-+arm-buildroot-linux-uclibcgnueabi_sdk-buildroot.tar.gz+. Save this
-tarball, as it is now the toolchain that you can re-use as an external
-toolchain in other Buildroot projects.
-
-In those other Buildroot projects, in the *Toolchain* menu:
-
-* Set *Toolchain type* to *External toolchain*
-
-* Set *Toolchain* to *Custom toolchain*
-
-* Set *Toolchain origin* to *Toolchain to be downloaded and installed*
-
-* Set *Toolchain URL* to +file:///path/to/your/sdk/tarball.tar.gz+
-
-===== External toolchain wrapper
-
-When using an external toolchain, Buildroot generates a wrapper program,
-that transparently passes the appropriate options (according to the
-configuration) to the external toolchain programs. In case you need to
-debug this wrapper to check exactly what arguments are passed, you can
-set the environment variable +BR2_DEBUG_WRAPPER+ to either one of:
-
-* +0+, empty or not set: no debug
-
-* +1+: trace all arguments on a single line
-
-* +2+: trace one argument per line
-
-=== /dev management
-
-On a Linux system, the +/dev+ directory contains special files, called
-_device files_, that allow userspace applications to access the
-hardware devices managed by the Linux kernel. Without these _device
-files_, your userspace applications would not be able to use the
-hardware devices, even if they are properly recognized by the Linux
-kernel.
-
-Under +System configuration+, +/dev management+, Buildroot offers four
-different solutions to handle the +/dev+ directory :
-
- * The first solution is *Static using device table*. This is the old
-   classical way of handling device files in Linux. With this method,
-   the device files are persistently stored in the root filesystem
-   (i.e. they persist across reboots), and there is nothing that will
-   automatically create and remove those device files when hardware
-   devices are added or removed from the system. Buildroot therefore
-   creates a standard set of device files using a _device table_, the
-   default one being stored in +system/device_table_dev.txt+ in the
-   Buildroot source code. This file is processed when Buildroot
-   generates the final root filesystem image, and the _device files_
-   are therefore not visible in the +output/target+ directory. The
-   +BR2_ROOTFS_STATIC_DEVICE_TABLE+ option allows to change the
-   default device table used by Buildroot, or to add an additional
-   device table, so that additional _device files_ are created by
-   Buildroot during the build. So, if you use this method, and a
-   _device file_ is missing in your system, you can for example create
-   a +board/<yourcompany>/<yourproject>/device_table_dev.txt+ file
-   that contains the description of your additional _device files_,
-   and then you can set +BR2_ROOTFS_STATIC_DEVICE_TABLE+ to
-   +system/device_table_dev.txt
-   board/<yourcompany>/<yourproject>/device_table_dev.txt+. For more
-   details about the format of the device table file, see
-   xref:makedev-syntax[].
-
- * The second solution is *Dynamic using devtmpfs only*. _devtmpfs_ is
-   a virtual filesystem inside the Linux kernel that has been
-   introduced in kernel 2.6.32 (if you use an older kernel, it is not
-   possible to use this option). When mounted in +/dev+, this virtual
-   filesystem will automatically make _device files_ appear and
-   disappear as hardware devices are added and removed from the
-   system. This filesystem is not persistent across reboots: it is
-   filled dynamically by the kernel. Using _devtmpfs_ requires the
-   following kernel configuration options to be enabled:
-   +CONFIG_DEVTMPFS+ and +CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT+. When Buildroot is in
-   charge of building the Linux kernel for your embedded device, it
-   makes sure that those two options are enabled. However, if you
-   build your Linux kernel outside of Buildroot, then it is your
-   responsibility to enable those two options (if you fail to do so,
-   your Buildroot system will not boot).
-
- * The third solution is *Dynamic using devtmpfs + mdev*. This method
-   also relies on the _devtmpfs_ virtual filesystem detailed above (so
-   the requirement to have +CONFIG_DEVTMPFS+ and
-   +CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT+ enabled in the kernel configuration still
-   apply), but adds the +mdev+ userspace utility on top of it. +mdev+
-   is a program part of BusyBox that the kernel will call every time a
-   device is added or removed. Thanks to the +/etc/mdev.conf+
-   configuration file, +mdev+ can be configured to for example, set
-   specific permissions or ownership on a device file, call a script
-   or application whenever a device appears or disappear,
-   etc. Basically, it allows _userspace_ to react on device addition
-   and removal events. +mdev+ can for example be used to automatically
-   load kernel modules when devices appear on the system. +mdev+ is
-   also important if you have devices that require a firmware, as it
-   will be responsible for pushing the firmware contents to the
-   kernel. +mdev+ is a lightweight implementation (with fewer
-   features) of +udev+. For more details about +mdev+ and the syntax
-   of its configuration file, see
-   http://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/docs/mdev.txt.
-
- * The fourth solution is *Dynamic using devtmpfs + eudev*. This
-   method also relies on the _devtmpfs_ virtual filesystem detailed
-   above, but adds the +eudev+ userspace daemon on top of it. +eudev+
-   is a daemon that runs in the background, and gets called by the
-   kernel when a device gets added or removed from the system. It is a
-   more heavyweight solution than +mdev+, but provides higher
-   flexibility.  +eudev+ is a standalone version of +udev+, the
-   original userspace daemon used in most desktop Linux distributions,
-   which is now part of Systemd. For more details, see
-   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udev.
-
-The Buildroot developers recommendation is to start with the *Dynamic
-using devtmpfs only* solution, until you have the need for userspace
-to be notified when devices are added/removed, or if firmwares are
-needed, in which case *Dynamic using devtmpfs + mdev* is usually a
-good solution.
-
-Note that if +systemd+ is chosen as init system, /dev management will
-be performed by the +udev+ program provided by +systemd+.
-
-=== init system
-
-The _init_ program is the first userspace program started by the
-kernel (it carries the PID number 1), and is responsible for starting
-the userspace services and programs (for example: web server,
-graphical applications, other network servers, etc.).
-
-Buildroot allows to use three different types of init systems, which
-can be chosen from +System configuration+, +Init system+:
-
- * The first solution is *BusyBox*. Amongst many programs, BusyBox has
-   an implementation of a basic +init+ program, which is sufficient
-   for most embedded systems. Enabling the +BR2_INIT_BUSYBOX+ will
-   ensure BusyBox will build and install its +init+ program. This is
-   the default solution in Buildroot. The BusyBox +init+ program will
-   read the +/etc/inittab+ file at boot to know what to do. The syntax
-   of this file can be found in
-   http://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/examples/inittab (note that
-   BusyBox +inittab+ syntax is special: do not use a random +inittab+
-   documentation from the Internet to learn about BusyBox
-   +inittab+). The default +inittab+ in Buildroot is stored in
-   +system/skeleton/etc/inittab+. Apart from mounting a few important
-   filesystems, the main job the default inittab does is to start the
-   +/etc/init.d/rcS+ shell script, and start a +getty+ program (which
-   provides a login prompt).
-
- * The second solution is *systemV*. This solution uses the old
-   traditional _sysvinit_ program, packed in Buildroot in
-   +package/sysvinit+. This was the solution used in most desktop
-   Linux distributions, until they switched to more recent
-   alternatives such as Upstart or Systemd. +sysvinit+ also works with
-   an +inittab+ file (which has a slightly different syntax than the
-   one from BusyBox). The default +inittab+ installed with this init
-   solution is located in +package/sysvinit/inittab+.
-
- * The third solution is *systemd*. +systemd+ is the new generation
-   init system for Linux. It does far more than traditional _init_
-   programs: aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket and
-   D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting
-   of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux control groups,
-   supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state,
-   etc. +systemd+ will be useful on relatively complex embedded
-   systems, for example the ones requiring D-Bus and services
-   communicating between each other. It is worth noting that +systemd+
-   brings a fairly big number of large dependencies: +dbus+, +udev+
-   and more. For more details about +systemd+, see
-   http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd.
-
-The solution recommended by Buildroot developers is to use the
-*BusyBox init* as it is sufficient for most embedded
-systems. *systemd* can be used for more complex situations.

-== Contributing to Buildroot
-
-There are many ways in which you can contribute to Buildroot: analyzing
-and fixing bugs, analyzing and fixing package build failures detected by
-the autobuilders, testing and reviewing patches sent by other
-developers, working on the items in our TODO list and sending your own
-improvements to Buildroot or its manual. The following sections give a
-little more detail on each of these items.
-
-If you are interested in contributing to Buildroot, the first thing you
-should do is to subscribe to the Buildroot mailing list. This list is
-the main way of interacting with other Buildroot developers and to send
-contributions to. If you aren't subscribed yet, then refer to
-xref:community-resources[] for the subscription link.
-
-If you are going to touch the code, it is highly recommended to use a
-git repository of Buildroot, rather than starting from an extracted
-source code tarball. Git is the easiest way to develop from and directly
-send your patches to the mailing list. Refer to xref:getting-buildroot[]
-for more information on obtaining a Buildroot git tree.
-
-=== Reproducing, analyzing and fixing bugs
-
-A first way of contributing is to have a look at the open bug reports in
-the https://bugs.buildroot.org/buglist.cgi?product=buildroot[Buildroot bug
-tracker]. As we strive to keep the bug count as small as possible, all
-help in reproducing, analyzing and fixing reported bugs is more than
-welcome. Don't hesitate to add a comment to bug reports reporting your
-findings, even if you don't yet see the full picture.
-
-=== Analyzing and fixing autobuild failures
-
-The Buildroot autobuilders are a set of build machines that continuously
-run Buildroot builds based on random configurations. This is done for
-all architectures supported by Buildroot, with various toolchains, and
-with a random selection of packages. With the large commit activity on
-Buildroot, these autobuilders are a great help in detecting problems
-very early after commit.
-
-All build results are available at http://autobuild.buildroot.org[],
-statistics are at http://autobuild.buildroot.org/stats.php[]. Every day,
-an overview of all failed packages is sent to the mailing list.
-
-Detecting problems is great, but obviously these problems have to be
-fixed as well. Your contribution is very welcome here! There are
-basically two things that can be done:
-
-- Analyzing the problems. The daily summary mails do not contain details
-  about the actual failures: in order to see what's going on you have to
-  open the build log and check the last output. Having someone doing
-  this for all packages in the mail is very useful for other developers,
-  as they can make a quick initial analysis based on this output alone.
-
-- Fixing a problem. When fixing autobuild failures, you should follow
-  these steps:
-  . Check if you can reproduce the problem by building with the same
-    configuration. You can do this manually, or use the
-    http://git.buildroot.org/buildroot-test/tree/utils/br-reproduce-build[br-reproduce-build]
-    script that will automatically clone a Buildroot git repository,
-    checkout the correct revision, download and set the right
-    configuration, and start the build.
-  . Analyze the problem and create a fix.
-  . Verify that the problem is really fixed by starting from a clean
-    Buildroot tree and only applying your fix.
-  . Send the fix to the Buildroot mailing list (see
-    xref:submitting-patches[]). In case you created a patch against the
-    package sources, you should also send the patch upstream so that the
-    problem will be fixed in a later release, and the patch in Buildroot
-    can be removed.
-    In the commit message of a patch fixing an autobuild failure, add a
-    reference to the build result directory, as follows:
----------------------
-Fixes: http://autobuild.buildroot.org/results/51000a9d4656afe9e0ea6f07b9f8ed374c2e4069
----------------------
-
-=== Reviewing and testing patches
-
-With the amount of patches sent to the mailing list each day, the
-maintainer has a very hard job to judge which patches are ready to apply
-and which ones aren't. Contributors can greatly help here by reviewing
-and testing these patches.
-
-In the review process, do not hesitate to respond to patch submissions
-for remarks, suggestions or anything that will help everyone to
-understand the patches and make them better. Please use internet
-style replies in plain text emails when responding to patch
-submissions.
-
-To indicate approval of a patch, there are three formal tags that keep
-track of this approval. To add your tag to a patch, reply to it with the
-approval tag below the original author's Signed-off-by line. These tags
-will be picked up automatically by patchwork (see
-xref:apply-patches-patchwork[]) and will be part of the commit log when
-the patch is accepted.
-
-Tested-by:: Indicates that the patch has been tested successfully.
-  You are encouraged to specify what kind of testing you performed
-  (compile-test on architecture X and Y, runtime test on target A,
-  ...). This additional information helps other testers and the
-  maintainer.
-
-Reviewed-by:: Indicates that you code-reviewed the patch and did your
-  best in spotting problems, but you are not sufficiently familiar with
-  the area touched to provide an Acked-by tag. This means that there
-  may be remaining problems in the patch that would be spotted by
-  someone with more experience in that area. Should such problems be
-  detected, your Reviewed-by tag remains appropriate and you cannot
-  be blamed.
-
-Acked-by:: Indicates that you code-reviewed the patch and you are
-  familiar enough with the area touched to feel that the patch can be
-  committed as-is (no additional changes required). In case it later
-  turns out that something is wrong with the patch, your Acked-by could
-  be considered inappropriate. The difference between Acked-by and
-  Reviewed-by is thus mainly that you are prepared to take the blame on
-  Acked patches, but not on Reviewed ones.
-
-If you reviewed a patch and have comments on it, you should simply reply
-to the patch stating these comments, without providing a Reviewed-by or
-Acked-by tag. These tags should only be provided if you judge the patch
-to be good as it is.
-
-It is important to note that neither Reviewed-by nor Acked-by imply
-that testing has been performed. To indicate that you both reviewed and
-tested the patch, provide two separate tags (Reviewed/Acked-by and
-Tested-by).
-
-Note also that _any developer_ can provide Tested/Reviewed/Acked-by
-tags, without exception, and we encourage everyone to do this. Buildroot
-does not have a defined group of _core_ developers, it just so happens
-that some developers are more active than others. The maintainer will
-value tags according to the track record of their submitter. Tags
-provided by a regular contributor will naturally be trusted more than
-tags provided by a newcomer. As you provide tags more regularly, your
-'trustworthiness' (in the eyes of the maintainer) will go up, but _any_
-tag provided is valuable.
-
-Buildroot's Patchwork website can be used to pull in patches for testing
-purposes. Please see xref:apply-patches-patchwork[] for more
-information on using Buildroot's Patchwork website to apply patches.
-
-[[apply-patches-patchwork]]
-==== Applying Patches from Patchwork
-
-The main use of Buildroot's Patchwork website for a developer is for
-pulling in patches into their local git repository for testing
-purposes.
-
-When browsing patches in the patchwork management interface, an +mbox+
-link is provided at the top of the page. Copy this link address and
-run the following commands:
-
----------------------
-$ git checkout -b <test-branch-name>
-$ wget -O - <mbox-url> | git am
----------------------
-
-Another option for applying patches is to create a bundle. A bundle is
-a set of patches that you can group together using the patchwork
-interface. Once the bundle is created and the bundle is made public,
-you can copy the +mbox+ link for the bundle and apply the bundle
-using the above commands.
-
-
-=== Work on items from the TODO list
-
-If you want to contribute to Buildroot but don't know where to start,
-and you don't like any of the above topics, you can always work on items
-from the http://elinux.org/Buildroot#Todo_list[Buildroot TODO list].
-Don't hesitate to discuss an item first on the mailing list or on IRC.
-Do edit the wiki to indicate when you start working on an item, so we
-avoid duplicate efforts.
-
-[[submitting-patches]]
-=== Submitting patches
-
-[NOTE]
-_Please, do not attach patches to bugs, send them to the mailing list
-instead_.
-
-If you made some changes to Buildroot and you would like to contribute
-them to the Buildroot project, proceed as follows.
-
-==== The formatting of a patch
-
-We expect patches to be formatted in a specific way. This is necessary
-to make it easy to review patches, to be able to apply them easily to
-the git repository, to make it easy to find back in the history how
-and why things have changed, and to make it possible to use +git
-bisect+ to locate the origin of a problem.
-
-First of all, it is essential that the patch has a good commit
-message. The commit message should start with a separate line with a
-brief summary of the change, prefixed by the area touched by the
-patch. A few examples of good commit titles:
-
-* +package/linuxptp: bump version to 2.0+
-
-* +configs/imx23evk: bump Linux version to 4.19+
-
-* +package/pkg-generic: postpone evaluation of dependency conditions+
-
-* +boot/uboot: needs host-{flex,bison}+
-
-* +support/testing: add python-ubjson tests+
-
-The description that follows the prefix should start with a lower case
-letter (i.e "bump", "needs", "postpone", "add" in the above examples).
-
-Second, the body of the commit message should describe _why_ this
-change is needed, and if necessary also give details about _how_ it
-was done. When writing the commit message, think of how the reviewers
-will read it, but also think about how you will read it when you look
-at this change again a few years down the line.
-
-Third, the patch itself should do only one change, but do it
-completely. Two unrelated or weakly related changes should usually be
-done in two separate patches. This usually means that a patch affects
-only a single package. If several changes are related, it is often
-still possible to split them up in small patches and apply them in a
-specific order. Small patches make it easier to review, and often
-make it easier to understand afterwards why a change was done.
-However, each patch must be complete. It is not allowed that the
-build is broken when only the first but not the second patch is
-applied. This is necessary to be able to use +git bisect+ afterwards.
-
-Of course, while you're doing your development, you're probably going
-back and forth between packages, and certainly not committing things
-immediately in a way that is clean enough for submission. So most
-developers rewrite the history of commits to produce a clean set of
-commits that is appropriate for submission. To do this, you need to
-use _interactive rebasing_. You can learn about it
-https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History[in the Pro
-Git book]. Sometimes, it is even easier to discard you history with
-+git reset --soft origin/master+ and select individual changes with
-+git add -i+ or +git add -p+.
-
-Finally, the patch should be signed off. This is done by adding
-+Signed-off-by: Your Real Name <your@email.address>+ at the end of the
-commit message. +git commit -s+ does that for you, if configured
-properly. The +Signed-off-by+ tag means that you publish the patch
-under the Buildroot license (i.e. GPL-2.0+, except for package patches,
-which have the upstream license), and that you are allowed to do so.
-See http://developercertificate.org/[the Developer Certificate of
-Origin] for details.
-
-When adding new packages, you should submit every package in a
-separate patch. This patch should have the update to
-+package/Config.in+, the package +Config.in+ file, the +.mk+ file, the
-+.hash+ file, any init script, and all package patches. If the package
-has many sub-options, these are sometimes better added as separate
-follow-up patches. The summary line should be something like
-+<packagename>: new package+. The body of the commit message can be
-empty for simple packages, or it can contain the description of the
-package (like the Config.in help text). If anything special has to be
-done to build the package, this should also be explained explicitly in
-the commit message body.
-
-When you bump a package to a new version, you should also submit a
-separate patch for each package. Don't forget to update the +.hash+
-file, or add it if it doesn't exist yet. Also don't forget to check if
-the +_LICENSE+ and +_LICENSE_FILES+ are still valid. The summary line
-should be something like +<packagename>: bump to version <new
-version>+. If the new version only contains security updates compared
-to the existing one, the summary should be +<packagename>: security
-bump to version <new version>+ and the commit message body should show
-the CVE numbers that are fixed. If some package patches can be removed
-in the new version, it should be explained explicitly why they can be
-removed, preferably with the upstream commit ID. Also any other
-required changes should be explained explicitly, like configure
-options that no longer exist or are no longer needed.
-
-If you are interested in getting notified of build failures and of
-further changes in the packages you added or modified, please add
-yourself to the DEVELOPERS file. This should be done in the same patch
-creating or modifying the package. See xref:DEVELOPERS[the DEVELOPERS file]
-for more information.
-
-Buildroot provides a handy tool to check for common coding style
-mistakes on files you created or modified, called +check-package+ (see
-xref:check-package[] for more information).
-
-==== Preparing a patch series
-
-Starting from the changes committed in your local git view, _rebase_
-your development branch on top of the upstream tree before generating
-a patch set. To do so, run:
-
----------------------
-$ git fetch --all --tags
-$ git rebase origin/master
----------------------
-
-Now, you are ready to generate then submit your patch set.
-
-To generate it, run:
-
----------------------
-$ git format-patch -M -n -s -o outgoing origin/master
----------------------
-
-This will generate patch files in the +outgoing+ subdirectory,
-automatically adding the +Signed-off-by+ line.
-
-Once patch files are generated, you can review/edit the commit message
-before submitting them, using your favorite text editor.
-
-Buildroot provides a handy tool to know to whom your patches should be
-sent, called +get-developers+ (see xref:DEVELOPERS[] for more
-information). This tool reads your patches and outputs the appropriate
-+git send-email+ command to use:
-
----------------------
-$ ./utils/get-developers outgoing/*
----------------------
-
-Use the output of +get-developers+ to send your patches:
-
----------------------
-$ git send-email --to buildroot@buildroot.org --cc bob --cc alice outgoing/*
----------------------
-
-Alternatively, +get-developers -e+ can be used directly with the
-+--cc-cmd+ argument to +git send-email+ to automatically CC the
-affected developers:
-
----------------------
-$ git send-email --to buildroot@buildroot.org \
-      --cc-cmd './utils/get-developers -e' origin/master
----------------------
-
-+git+ can be configured to automatically do this out of the box with:
-
----------------------
-$ git config sendemail.to buildroot@buildroot.org
-$ git config sendemail.ccCmd "$(pwd)/utils/get-developers -e"
----------------------
-
-And then just do:
-
----------------------
-$ git send-email origin/master
----------------------
-
-Note that +git+ should be configured to use your mail account.
-To configure +git+, see +man git-send-email+ or google it.
-
-If you do not use +git send-email+, make sure posted *patches are not
-line-wrapped*, otherwise they cannot easily be applied. In such a case,
-fix your e-mail client, or better yet, learn to use +git send-email+.
-
-==== Cover letter
-
-If you want to present the whole patch set in a separate mail, add
-+--cover-letter+ to the +git format-patch+ command (see +man
-git-format-patch+ for further information). This will generate a
-template for an introduction e-mail to your patch series.
-
-A 'cover letter' may be useful to introduce the changes you propose
-in the following cases:
-
-* large number of commits in the series;
-
-* deep impact of the changes in the rest of the project;
-
-* RFC footnote:[RFC: (Request for comments) change proposal];
-
-* whenever you feel it will help presenting your work, your choices,
-  the review process, etc.
-
-==== Patches for maintenance branches
-
-When fixing bugs on a maintenance branch, bugs should be fixed on the
-master branch first. The commit log for such a patch may then contain a
-post-commit note specifying what branches are affected:
-
-----
-package/foo: fix stuff
-
-Signed-off-by: Your Real Name <your@email.address>
----
-Backport to: 2020.02.x, 2020.05.x
-(2020.08.x not affected as the version was bumped)
-----
-
-Those changes will then be backported by a maintainer to the affected
-branches.
-
-However, some bugs may apply only to a specific release, for example
-because it is using an older version of a package. In that case, patches
-should be based off the maintenance branch, and the patch subject prefix
-must include the maintenance branch name (for example "[PATCH 2020.02.x]").
-This can be done with the +git format-patch+ flag +--subject-prefix+:
-
----------------------
-$ git format-patch --subject-prefix "PATCH 2020.02.x" \
-    -M -s -o outgoing origin/2020.02.x
----------------------
-
-Then send the patches with +git send-email+, as described above.
-
-==== Patch revision changelog
-
-When improvements are requested, the new revision of each commit
-should include a changelog of the modifications between each
-submission. Note that when your patch series is introduced by a cover
-letter, an overall changelog may be added to the cover letter in
-addition to the changelog in the individual commits.
-The best thing to rework a patch series is by interactive rebasing:
-+git rebase -i origin/master+. Consult the git manual for more
-information.
-
-When added to the individual commits, this changelog is added when
-editing the commit message. Below the +Signed-off-by+ section, add
-+---+ and your changelog.
-
-Although the changelog will be visible for the reviewers in the mail
-thread, as well as in http://patchwork.buildroot.org[patchwork], +git+
-will automatically ignores lines below +---+ when the patch will be
-merged. This is the intended behavior: the changelog is not meant to
-be preserved forever in the +git+ history of the project.
-
-Hereafter the recommended layout:
-
----------------
-Patch title: short explanation, max 72 chars
-
-A paragraph that explains the problem, and how it manifests itself. If
-the problem is complex, it is OK to add more paragraphs. All paragraphs
-should be wrapped at 72 characters.
-
-A paragraph that explains the root cause of the problem. Again, more
-than one paragraph is OK.
-
-Finally, one or more paragraphs that explain how the problem is solved.
-Don't hesitate to explain complex solutions in detail.

-  - bar buz
-
-Changes v1 -> v2:
-  - alpha bravo  (suggested by John)
-  - charly delta
----------------
-
-Any patch revision should include the version number. The version number
-is simply composed of the letter +v+ followed by an +integer+ greater or
-equal to two (i.e. "PATCH v2", "PATCH v3" ...).
-
-This can be easily handled with +git format-patch+ by using the option
-+--subject-prefix+:
-
----------------------
-$ git format-patch --subject-prefix "PATCH v4" \
-    -M -s -o outgoing origin/master
----------------------
-
-Since git version 1.8.1, you can also use +-v <n>+ (where <n> is the
-version number):
-
----------------------
-$ git format-patch -v4 -M -s -o outgoing origin/master
----------------------
-
-When you provide a new version of a patch, please mark the old one as
-superseded in http://patchwork.buildroot.org[patchwork]. You need to
-create an account on http://patchwork.buildroot.org[patchwork] to be
-able to modify the status of your patches. Note that you can only change
-the status of patches you submitted yourself, which means the email
-address you register in http://patchwork.buildroot.org[patchwork] should
-match the one you use for sending patches to the mailing list.
-
-You can also add the +--in-reply-to <message-id>+ option when
-submitting a patch to the mailing list. The id of the mail to reply to
-can be found under the "Message Id" tag on
-http://patchwork.buildroot.org[patchwork].  The advantage of
-*in-reply-to* is that patchwork will automatically mark the previous
-version of the patch as superseded.
-
-[[reporting-bugs]]
-=== Reporting issues/bugs or getting help
-
-Before reporting any issue, please check in
-xref:community-resources[the mailing list archive] whether someone has
-already reported and/or fixed a similar problem.
-
-However you choose to report bugs or get help, either by
-opening a bug in the xref:community-resources[bug tracker] or by
-xref:community-resources[sending a mail to the mailing list], there are
-a number of details to provide in order to help people reproduce and
-find a solution to the issue.
-
-Try to think as if you were trying to help someone else; in
-that case, what would you need?
-
-Here is a short list of details to provide in such case:
-
-* host machine (OS/release)
-* version of Buildroot
-* target for which the build fails
-* package(s) for which the build fails
-* the command that fails and its output
-* any information you think that may be relevant
-
-Additionally, you should add the +.config+ file (or if you know how, a
-+defconfig+; see xref:customize-store-buildroot-config[]).
-
-If some of these details are too large, do not hesitate to use a
-pastebin service. Note that not all available pastebin services will
-preserve Unix-style line terminators when downloading raw pastes.
-Following pastebin services are known to work correctly:
-- https://gist.github.com/
-- http://code.bulix.org/
-
-=== Using the runtime tests framework
-
-Buildroot includes a run-time testing framework built upon Python
-scripting and QEMU runtime execution. The goals of the framework are
-the following:
-
-* build a well defined Buildroot configuration
-* optionally, verify some properties of the build output
-* optionally, boot the build results under Qemu, and verify that a
-  given feature is working as expected
-
-The entry point to use the runtime tests framework is the
-+support/testing/run-tests+ tool, which has a series of options
-documented in the tool's help '-h' description. Some common options
-include setting the download folder, the output folder, keeping build
-output, and for multiple test cases, you can set the JLEVEL for each.
-
-Here is an example walk through of running a test case.
-
-* For a first step, let us see what all the test case options are. The test
-cases can be listed by executing +support/testing/run-tests -l+. These tests
-can all be run individually during test development from the console. Both
-one at a time and selectively as a group of a subset of tests.
-
----------------------
-$ support/testing/run-tests -l
-List of tests
-test_run (tests.utils.test_check_package.TestCheckPackage)
-test_run (tests.toolchain.test_external.TestExternalToolchainBuildrootMusl) ... ok

-test_run (tests.init.test_busybox.TestInitSystemBusyboxRwNet) ... ok
-
-Ran 157 tests in 0.021s
-
-OK
----------------------
-
-* Then, to run one test case:
-
----------------------
-$ support/testing/run-tests -d dl -o output_folder -k tests.init.test_busybox.TestInitSystemBusyboxRw
-15:03:26 TestInitSystemBusyboxRw                  Starting
-15:03:28 TestInitSystemBusyboxRw                  Building
-15:08:18 TestInitSystemBusyboxRw                  Building done
-15:08:27 TestInitSystemBusyboxRw                  Cleaning up
-.
-Ran 1 test in 301.140s
-
-OK
----------------------
-
-The standard output indicates if the test is successful or not. By
-default, the output folder for the test is deleted automatically
-unless the option +-k+ is passed to *keep* the output directory.
-
-==== Creating a test case
-
-Within the Buildroot repository, the testing framework is organized at the
-top level in +support/testing/+ by folders of +conf+, +infra+ and +tests+.
-All the test cases live under the +tests+ folder and are organized in various
-folders representing the category of test.
-
-The best way to get familiar with how to create a test case is to look
-at a few of the basic file system +support/testing/tests/fs/+ and init
-+support/testing/tests/init/+ test scripts. Those tests give good
-examples of a basic tests that include both checking the build
-results, and doing runtime tests. There are other more advanced cases
-that use things like nested +br2-external+ folders to provide
-skeletons and additional packages.
-
-Creating a basic test case involves:
-
-* Defining a test class that inherits from +infra.basetest.BRTest+
-
-* Defining the +config+ member of the test class, to the Buildroot
-  configuration to build for this test case. It can optionally rely on
-  configuration snippets provided by the runtime test infrastructure:
-  +infra.basetest.BASIC_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIG+ to get a basic
-  architecture/toolchain configuration, and
-  +infra.basetest.MINIMAL_CONFIG+ to not build any filesystem. The
-  advantage of using +infra.basetest.BASIC_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIG+ is that a
-  matching Linux kernel image is provided, which allows to boot the
-  resulting image in Qemu without having to build a Linux kernel image
-  as part of the test case, therefore significant decreasing the build
-  time required for the test case.
-
-* Implementing a +def test_run(self):+ function to implement the
-  actual tests to run after the build has completed. They may be tests
-  that verify the build output, by running command on the host using
-  the +run_cmd_on_host()+ helper function. Or they may boot the
-  generated system in Qemu using the +Emulator+ object available as
-  +self.emulator+ in the test case. For example +self.emulator.boot()+
-  allows to boot the system in Qemu, +self.emulator.login()+ allows to
-  login, +self.emulator.run()+ allows to run shell commands inside
-  Qemu.
-
-After creating the test script, add yourself to the +DEVELOPERS+ file to
-be the maintainer of that test case.
-
-==== Debugging a test case
-
-When a test case runs, the +output_folder+ will contain the following:
-
----------------------
-$ ls output_folder/
-TestInitSystemBusyboxRw/
-TestInitSystemBusyboxRw-build.log
-TestInitSystemBusyboxRw-run.log
----------------------
-
-+TestInitSystemBusyboxRw/+ is the Buildroot output directory, and it
-is preserved only if the +-k+ option is passed.
-
-+TestInitSystemBusyboxRw-build.log+ is the log of the Buildroot build.
-
-+TestInitSystemBusyboxRw-run.log+ is the log of the Qemu boot and
-test. This file will only exist if the build was successful and the
-test case involves booting under Qemu.
-
-If you want to manually run Qemu to do manual tests of the build
-result, the first few lines of +TestInitSystemBusyboxRw-run.log+
-contain the Qemu command line to use.
-
-You can also make modifications to the current sources inside the
-+output_folder+ (e.g. for debug purposes) and rerun the standard
-Buildroot make targets (in order to regenerate the complete image with
-the new modifications) and then rerun the test.
-
-==== Runtime tests and Gitlab CI
-
-All runtime tests are regularly executed by Buildroot Gitlab CI
-infrastructure, see .gitlab.yml and
-https://gitlab.com/buildroot.org/buildroot/-/jobs.
-
-You can also use Gitlab CI to test your new test cases, or verify that
-existing tests continue to work after making changes in Buildroot.
-
-In order to achieve this, you need to create a fork of the Buildroot
-project on Gitlab, and be able to push branches to your Buildroot fork
-on Gitlab.
-
-The name of the branch that you push will determine if a Gitlab CI
-pipeline will be triggered or not, and for which test cases.
-
-In the examples below, the <name> component of the branch name is an
-arbitrary string you choose.
-
-* To trigger all run-test test case jobs, push a branch that ends with
-  +-runtime-tests+:
-
----------------------
- $ git push gitlab HEAD:<name>-runtime-tests
----------------------
-
-* To trigger one or several test case jobs, push a branch that ends
-  with the complete test case name
-  (+tests.init.test_busybox.TestInitSystemBusyboxRo+) or with the name
-  of a category of tests (+tests.init.test_busybox+):
-
----------------------
- $ git push gitlab HEAD:<name>-<test case name>
----------------------
-
-Example to run one test:
-
----------------------
- $ git push gitlab HEAD:foo-tests.init.test_busybox.TestInitSystemBusyboxRo
----------------------
-
-Examples to run several tests part of the same group:
-
----------------------
- $ git push gitlab HEAD:foo-tests.init.test_busybox
- $ git push gitlab HEAD:foo-tests.init

-=== Storing the Buildroot configuration
-
-The Buildroot configuration can be stored using the command
- +make savedefconfig+.
-
-This strips the Buildroot configuration down by removing configuration
-options that are at their default value. The result is stored in a file
-called +defconfig+. If you want to save it in another place, change the
-+BR2_DEFCONFIG+ option in the Buildroot configuration itself, or call
-make with +make savedefconfig BR2_DEFCONFIG=<path-to-defconfig>+.
-
-The recommended place to store this defconfig is
-+configs/<boardname>_defconfig+. If you follow this recommendation, the
-configuration will be listed in +make help+ and can be set again by
-running +make <boardname>_defconfig+.
-
-Alternatively, you can copy the file to any other place and rebuild with
-+make defconfig BR2_DEFCONFIG=<path-to-defconfig-file>+.
-
-[[customize-store-package-config]]
-=== Storing the configuration of other components
-
-The configuration files for BusyBox, the Linux kernel, Barebox, U-Boot
-and uClibc should be stored as well if changed. For each of these
-components, a Buildroot configuration option exists to point to an input
-configuration file, e.g. +BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE+. To store
-their configuration, set these configuration options to a path where you
-want to save the configuration files, and then use the helper targets
-described below to actually store the configuration.
-
-As explained in xref:customize-dir-structure[], the recommended path to
-store these configuration files is
-+board/<company>/<boardname>/foo.config+.
-
-Make sure that you create a configuration file 'before' changing
-the +BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE+ etc. options. Otherwise,
-Buildroot will try to access this config file, which doesn't exist
-yet, and will fail. You can create the configuration file by running
-+make linux-menuconfig+ etc.
-
-Buildroot provides a few helper targets to make the saving of
-configuration files easier.
-
-* +make linux-update-defconfig+ saves the linux configuration to the
-  path specified by +BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE+. It
-  simplifies the config file by removing default values. However,
-  this only works with kernels starting from 2.6.33. For earlier
-  kernels, use +make linux-update-config+.
-* +make busybox-update-config+ saves the busybox configuration to the
-  path specified by +BR2_PACKAGE_BUSYBOX_CONFIG+.
-* +make uclibc-update-config+ saves the uClibc configuration to the
-  path specified by +BR2_UCLIBC_CONFIG+.
-* +make barebox-update-defconfig+ saves the barebox configuration to the
-  path specified by +BR2_TARGET_BAREBOX_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE+.
-* +make uboot-update-defconfig+ saves the U-Boot configuration to the
-  path specified by +BR2_TARGET_UBOOT_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE+.
-* For at91bootstrap3, no helper exists so you have to copy the config
-  file manually to +BR2_TARGET_AT91BOOTSTRAP3_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE+.

-==== Setting file permissions and ownership and adding custom devices nodes
-
-Sometimes it is needed to set specific permissions or ownership on files
-or device nodes. For example, certain files may need to be owned by
-root. Since the post-build scripts are not run as root, you cannot do
-such changes from there unless you use an explicit fakeroot from the
-post-build script.
-
-Instead, Buildroot provides support for so-called _permission tables_.
-To use this feature, set config option +BR2_ROOTFS_DEVICE_TABLE+ to a
-space-separated list of permission tables, regular text files following
-the xref:makedev-syntax[makedev syntax].
-
-If you are using a static device table (i.e. not using +devtmpfs+,
-+mdev+, or +(e)udev+) then you can add device nodes using the same
-syntax, in so-called _device tables_. To use this feature, set config
-option +BR2_ROOTFS_STATIC_DEVICE_TABLE+ to a space-separated list of
-device tables.
-
-As shown in xref:customize-dir-structure[], the recommended location for
-such files is +board/<company>/<boardname>/+.
-
-It should be noted that if the specific permissions or device nodes are
-related to a specific application, you should set variables
-+FOO_PERMISSIONS+ and +FOO_DEVICES+ in the package's +.mk+ file instead
-(see xref:generic-package-reference[]).

-=== Recommended directory structure
-
-When customizing Buildroot for your project, you will be creating one or
-more project-specific files that need to be stored somewhere. While most
-of these files could be placed in _any_ location as their path is to be
-specified in the Buildroot configuration, the Buildroot developers
-recommend a specific directory structure which is described in this
-section.
-
-Orthogonal to this directory structure, you can choose _where_ you place
-this structure itself: either inside the Buildroot tree, or outside of
-it using a br2-external tree. Both options are valid, the choice is up
-to you.
-
------
-+-- board/
-|   +-- <company>/
-|       +-- <boardname>/

-Details on the files shown above are given further in this chapter.
-
-Note: if you choose to place this structure outside of the Buildroot
-tree but in a br2-external tree, the <company> and possibly <boardname>
-components may be superfluous and can be left out.
-
-==== Implementing layered customizations
-
-It is quite common for a user to have several related projects that partly
-need the same customizations. Instead of duplicating these
-customizations for each project, it is recommended to use a layered
-customization approach, as explained in this section.
-
-Almost all of the customization methods available in Buildroot, like
-post-build scripts and root filesystem overlays, accept a
-space-separated list of items. The specified items are always treated in
-order, from left to right. By creating more than one such item, one for
-the common customizations and another one for the really
-project-specific customizations, you can avoid unnecessary duplication.
-Each layer is typically embodied by a separate directory inside
-+board/<company>/+. Depending on your projects, you could even introduce
-more than two layers.
-
-An example directory structure for where a user has two customization
-layers 'common' and 'fooboard' is:
-
------
-+-- board/
-    +-- <company>/
-        +-- common/
-        |   +-- post_build.sh
-        |   +-- rootfs_overlay/
-        |   |   +-- ...
-        |   +-- patches/
-        |       +-- ...
-        |
-        +-- fooboard/
-            +-- linux.config
-            +-- busybox.config
-            +-- <other configuration files>
-            +-- post_build.sh
-            +-- rootfs_overlay/
-            |   +-- ...
-            +-- patches/
-                +-- ...
------
-
-For example, if the user has the +BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR+ configuration
-option set as:

-[[outside-br-custom]]
-=== Keeping customizations outside of Buildroot
-
-As already briefly mentioned in xref:customize-dir-structure[], you can
-place project-specific customizations in two locations:
-
- * directly within the Buildroot tree, typically maintaining them using
-   branches in a version control system so that upgrading to a newer
-   Buildroot release is easy.
-
- * outside of the Buildroot tree, using the _br2-external_ mechanism.
-   This mechanism allows to keep package recipes, board support and
-   configuration files outside of the Buildroot tree, while still
-   having them nicely integrated in the build logic. We call this
-   location a _br2-external tree_. This section explains how to use
-   the br2-external mechanism and what to provide in a br2-external
-   tree.
-
-One can tell Buildroot to use one or more br2-external trees by setting
-the +BR2_EXTERNAL+ make variable set to the path(s) of the br2-external
-tree(s) to use. It can be passed to any Buildroot +make+ invocation. It
-is automatically saved in the hidden +.br2-external.mk+ file in the output
-directory. Thanks to this, there is no need to pass +BR2_EXTERNAL+ at
-every +make+ invocation. It can however be changed at any time by
-passing a new value, and can be removed by passing an empty value.
-
-.Note
-The path to a br2-external tree can be either absolute or relative.
-If it is passed as a relative path, it is important to note that it is
-interpreted relative to the main Buildroot source directory, *not* to
-the Buildroot output directory.
-
-.Note:
-If using an br2-external tree from before Buildroot 2016.11, you need to
-convert it before you can use it with Buildroot 2016.11 onward. See
-xref:br2-external-converting[] for help on doing so.
-
-Some examples:
-
------
-buildroot/ $ make BR2_EXTERNAL=/path/to/foo menuconfig
------
-
-From now on, definitions from the +/path/to/foo+ br2-external tree
-will be used:
-
------
-buildroot/ $ make
-buildroot/ $ make legal-info
------
-
-We can switch to another br2-external tree at any time:
-
------
-buildroot/ $ make BR2_EXTERNAL=/where/we/have/bar xconfig
------
-
-We can also use multiple br2-external trees:
-
-----
-buildroot/ $ make BR2_EXTERNAL=/path/to/foo:/where/we/have/bar menuconfig
-----
-
-Or disable the usage of any br2-external tree:
-
------
-buildroot/ $ make BR2_EXTERNAL= xconfig
------
-
-==== Layout of a br2-external tree
-
-A br2-external tree must contain at least those three files, described
-in the following chapters:
-
- * +external.desc+
- * +external.mk+
- * +Config.in+
-
-Apart from those mandatory files, there may be additional and optional
-content that may be present in a br2-external tree, like the +configs/+
-or +provides/+ directories. They are described in the following chapters
-as well.
-
-A complete example br2-external tree layout is also described later.
-
-===== The +external.desc+ file
-
-That file describes the br2-external tree: the _name_ and _description_
-for that br2-external tree.
-
-The format for this file is line based, with each line starting by a
-keyword, followed by a colon and one or more spaces, followed by the
-value assigned to that keyword. There are two keywords currently
-recognised:
-
- * +name+, mandatory, defines the name for that br2-external tree. That
-   name must only use ASCII characters in the set +[A-Za-z0-9_]+; any
-   other character is forbidden. Buildroot sets the variable
-   +BR2_EXTERNAL_$(NAME)_PATH+ to the absolute path of the br2-external
-   tree, so that you can use it to refer to your br2-external tree. This
-   variable is available both in Kconfig, so you can use it to source your
-   Kconfig files (see below) and in the Makefile, so that you can use it
-   to include other Makefiles (see below) or refer to other files (like
-   data files) from your br2-external tree.
-+
-.Note:
-Since it is possible to use multiple br2-external trees at once, this
-  name is used by Buildroot to generate variables for each of those trees.
-  That name is used to identify your br2-external tree, so try to come up
-  with a name that really describes your br2-external tree, in order for
-  it to be relatively unique, so that it does not clash with another name
-  from another br2-external tree, especially if you are planning on
-  somehow sharing your br2-external tree with third parties or using
-  br2-external trees from third parties.
-
- * +desc+, optional, provides a short description for that br2-external
-   tree. It shall fit on a single line, is mostly free-form (see below),
-   and is used when displaying information about a br2-external tree (e.g.
-   above the list of defconfig files, or as the prompt in the menuconfig);
-   as such, it should relatively brief (40 chars is probably a good upper
-   limit). The description is available in the +BR2_EXTERNAL_$(NAME)_DESC+
-   variable.
-
-Examples of names and the corresponding +BR2_EXTERNAL_$(NAME)_PATH+
-variables:
-
-  * +FOO+ -> +BR2_EXTERNAL_FOO_PATH+
-  * +BAR_42+ -> +BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH+
-
-In the following examples, it is assumed the name to be set to +BAR_42+.
-
-.Note:
-Both +BR2_EXTERNAL_$(NAME)_PATH+ and `BR2_EXTERNAL_$(NAME)_DESC` are
-  available in the Kconfig files and the Makefiles. They are also
-  exported in the environment so are available in post-build, post-image
-  and in-fakeroot scripts.
-
-===== The +Config.in+ and +external.mk+ files
-
-Those files (which may each be empty) can be used to define package
-recipes (i.e. +foo/Config.in+ and +foo/foo.mk+ like for packages bundled
-in Buildroot itself) or other custom configuration options or make logic.
-
-Buildroot automatically includes the +Config.in+ from each br2-external
-tree to make it appear in the top-level configuration menu, and includes
-the +external.mk+ from each br2-external tree with the rest of the
-makefile logic.
-
-The main usage of this is to store package recipes. The recommended way
-to do this is to write a +Config.in+ file that looks like:
-
-------
-source "$BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH/package/package1/Config.in"
-source "$BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH/package/package2/Config.in"
-------
-
-Then, have an +external.mk+ file that looks like:
-
-------
-include $(sort $(wildcard $(BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH)/package/*/*.mk))
-------
-
-And then in +$(BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH)/package/package1+ and
-+$(BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH)/package/package2+ create normal
-Buildroot package recipes, as explained in xref:adding-packages[].
-If you prefer, you can also group the packages in subdirectories
-called <boardname> and adapt the above paths accordingly.
-
-You can also define custom configuration options in +Config.in+ and
-custom make logic in +external.mk+.
-
-===== The +configs/+ directory
-
-One can store Buildroot defconfigs in the +configs+ subdirectory of
-the br2-external tree. Buildroot will automatically show them in the
-output of +make list-defconfigs+ and allow them to be loaded with the
-normal +make <name>_defconfig+ command. They will be visible in the
-'make list-defconfigs' output, below an +External configs+ label that
-contains the name of the br2-external tree they are defined in.
-
-.Note:
-If a defconfig file is present in more than one br2-external tree, then
-the one from the last br2-external tree is used. It is thus possible
-to override a defconfig bundled in Buildroot or another br2-external
-tree.
-
-===== The +provides/+ directory
-
-For some packages, Buildroot provides a choice between two (or more)
-implementations of API-compatible such packages. For example, there is
-a choice to choose either libjpeg ot jpeg-turbo; there is one between
-openssl or libressl; there is one to select one of the known,
-pre-configured toolchains...
-
-It is possible for a br2-external to extend those choices, by providing
-a set of files that define those alternatives:
-
-* +provides/toolchains.in+ defines the pre-configured toolchains, which
-  will then be listed in the toolchain selection;
-* +provides/jpeg.in+ defines the alternative libjpeg implementations;
-* +provides/openssl.in+ defines the alternative openssl implementations;
-* +provides/skeleton.in+ defines the alternative skeleton implementations;
-* +provides/init.in+ defines the alternative init system implementations, this
-  can be used to select a default skeleton for your init.
-
-===== Free-form content
-
-One can store all the board-specific configuration files there, such
-as the kernel configuration, the root filesystem overlay, or any other
-configuration file for which Buildroot allows to set the location (by
-using the +BR2_EXTERNAL_$(NAME)_PATH+ variable). For example, you
-could set the paths to a global patch directory, to a rootfs overlay
-and to the kernel configuration file as follows (e.g. by running
-`make menuconfig` and filling in these options):
-
-----
-BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR=$(BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH)/patches/
-BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY=$(BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH)/board/<boardname>/overlay/
-BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE=$(BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH)/board/<boardname>/kernel.config
-----
-
-===== Additional Linux kernel extensions
-
-Additional Linux kernel extensions (see xref:linux-kernel-ext[]) can
-be added by storing them in the `linux/` directory at the root of a
-br2-external tree.
-
-===== Example layout
-
-Here is an example layout using all features of br2-external (the sample
-content is shown for the file above it, when it is relevant to explain
-the br2-external tree; this is all entirely made up just for the sake of
-illustration, of course):

-=== Adding project-specific packages
-
-In general, any new package should be added directly in the +package+
-directory and submitted to the Buildroot upstream project. How to add
-packages to Buildroot in general is explained in full detail in
-xref:adding-packages[] and will not be repeated here. However, your
-project may need some proprietary packages that cannot be upstreamed.
-This section will explain how you can keep such project-specific
-packages in a project-specific directory.
-
-As shown in xref:customize-dir-structure[], the recommended location for
-project-specific packages is +package/<company>/+. If you are using the
-br2-external tree feature (see xref:outside-br-custom[]) the recommended
-location is to put them in a sub-directory named +package/+ in your
-br2-external tree.
-
-However, Buildroot will not be aware of the packages in this location,
-unless we perform some additional steps. As explained in
-xref:adding-packages[], a package in Buildroot basically consists of two
-files: a +.mk+ file (describing how to build the package) and a
-+Config.in+ file (describing the configuration options for this
-package).
-
-Buildroot will automatically include the +.mk+ files in first-level
-subdirectories of the +package+ directory (using the pattern
-+package/\*/*.mk+). If we want Buildroot to include +.mk+ files from
-deeper subdirectories (like +package/<company>/package1/+) then we
-simply have to add a +.mk+ file in a first-level subdirectory that
-includes these additional +.mk+ files. Therefore, create a file
-+package/<company>/<company>.mk+ with following contents (assuming you
-have only one extra directory level below +package/<company>/+):
-
------
-include $(sort $(wildcard package/<company>/*/*.mk))
------
-
-For the +Config.in+ files, create a file +package/<company>/Config.in+
-that includes the +Config.in+ files of all your packages. An exhaustive
-list has to be provided since wildcards are not supported in the source command of kconfig.
-For example:
-
------
-source "package/<company>/package1/Config.in"
-source "package/<company>/package2/Config.in"
------
-
-Include this new file +package/<company>/Config.in+ from
-+package/Config.in+, preferably in a company-specific menu to make
-merges with future Buildroot versions easier.
-
-If using a br2-external tree, refer to xref:outside-br-custom[] for how
-to fill in those files.

-=== Adding project-specific patches
-
-It is sometimes useful to apply 'extra' patches to packages - on top of
-those provided in Buildroot. This might be used to support custom
-features in a project, for example, or when working on a new
-architecture.
-
-The +BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR+ configuration option can be used to specify
-a space separated list of one or more directories containing package
-patches.
-
-For a specific version +<packageversion>+ of a specific package
-+<packagename>+, patches are applied from +BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR+ as
-follows:
-
-. For every directory - +<global-patch-dir>+ - that exists in
-  +BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR+, a +<package-patch-dir>+ will be determined as
-  follows:
-+
-* +<global-patch-dir>/<packagename>/<packageversion>/+ if the
-  directory exists.
-+
-* Otherwise, +<global-patch-dir>/<packagename>+ if the directory
-  exists.
-
-. Patches will then be applied from a +<package-patch-dir>+ as
-  follows:
-+
-* If a +series+ file exists in the package directory, then patches are
-  applied according to the +series+ file;
-+
-* Otherwise, patch files matching +*.patch+ are applied in
-  alphabetical order.  So, to ensure they are applied in the right
-  order, it is highly recommended to name the patch files like this:
-  +<number>-<description>.patch+, where +<number>+ refers to the
-  'apply order'.
-
-For information about how patches are applied for a package, see
-xref:patch-apply-order[]
-
-The +BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR+ option is the preferred method for
-specifying a custom patch directory for packages. It can be used to
-specify a patch directory for any package in buildroot. It should also
-be used in place of the custom patch directory options that are
-available for packages such as U-Boot and Barebox. By doing this, it
-will allow a user to manage their patches from one top-level
-directory.
-
-The exception to +BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR+ being the preferred method for
-specifying custom patches is +BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_PATCH+.
-+BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_PATCH+ should be used to specify kernel patches that
-are available at a URL. *Note:* +BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_PATCH+ specifies kernel
-patches that are applied after patches available in +BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR+,
-as it is done from a post-patch hook of the Linux package.

-=== Customization _after_ the images have been created
-
-While post-build scripts (xref:rootfs-custom[]) are run _before_
-building the filesystem image, kernel and bootloader, *post-image
-scripts* can be used to perform some specific actions _after_ all images
-have been created.
-
-Post-image scripts can for example be used to automatically extract your
-root filesystem tarball in a location exported by your NFS server, or
-to create a special firmware image that bundles your root filesystem and
-kernel image, or any other custom action required for your project.
-
-To enable this feature, specify a space-separated list of post-image
-scripts in config option +BR2_ROOTFS_POST_IMAGE_SCRIPT+ (in the +System
-configuration+ menu). If you specify a relative path, it will be
-relative to the root of the Buildroot tree.
-
-Just like post-build scripts, post-image scripts are run with the main
-Buildroot tree as current working directory. The path to the +images+
-output directory is passed as the first argument to each script. If the
-config option +BR2_ROOTFS_POST_SCRIPT_ARGS+ is not empty, these
-arguments will be passed to the script too. All the scripts will be
-passed the exact same set of arguments, it is not possible to pass
-different sets of arguments to each script.
-
-Again just like for the post-build scripts, the scripts have access to
-the environment variables +BR2_CONFIG+, +HOST_DIR+, +STAGING_DIR+,
-+TARGET_DIR+, +BUILD_DIR+, +BINARIES_DIR+, +CONFIG_DIR+ and
-+BASE_DIR+.
-
-The post-image scripts will be executed as the user that executes
-Buildroot, which should normally _not_ be the root user. Therefore, any
-action requiring root permissions in one of these scripts will require
-special handling (usage of fakeroot or sudo), which is left to the
-script developer.

-=== Quick guide to storing your project-specific customizations
-
-Earlier in this chapter, the different methods for making
-project-specific customizations have been described. This section will
-now summarize all this by providing step-by-step instructions to storing your
-project-specific customizations. Clearly, the steps that are not relevant to
-your project can be skipped.
-
-1. +make menuconfig+ to configure toolchain, packages and kernel.
-1. +make linux-menuconfig+ to update the kernel config, similar for
-   other configuration like busybox, uclibc, ...
-1. +mkdir -p board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>+
-1. Set the following options to +board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/<package>.config+
-   (as far as they are relevant):
-   * +BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE+
-   * +BR2_PACKAGE_BUSYBOX_CONFIG+
-   * +BR2_UCLIBC_CONFIG+
-   * +BR2_TARGET_AT91BOOTSTRAP3_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE+
-   * +BR2_TARGET_BAREBOX_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE+
-   * +BR2_TARGET_UBOOT_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE+
-1. Write the configuration files:
-   * +make linux-update-defconfig+
-   * +make busybox-update-config+
-   * +make uclibc-update-config+
-   * +cp <output>/build/at91bootstrap3-*/.config
-     board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/at91bootstrap3.config+
-   * +make barebox-update-defconfig+
-   * +make uboot-update-defconfig+
-1. Create +board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/rootfs-overlay/+ and fill it
-   with additional files you need on your rootfs, e.g.
-   +board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/rootfs-overlay/etc/inittab+.
-   Set +BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY+
-   to +board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/rootfs-overlay+.
-1. Create a post-build script
-   +board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/post_build.sh+. Set
-   +BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT+ to
-   +board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/post_build.sh+
-1. If additional setuid permissions have to be set or device nodes have
-   to be created, create +board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/device_table.txt+
-   and add that path to +BR2_ROOTFS_DEVICE_TABLE+.
-1. If additional user accounts have to be created, create
-   +board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/users_table.txt+ and add that path
-   to +BR2_ROOTFS_USERS_TABLES+.
-1. To add custom patches to certain packages, set +BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR+
-   to +board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/patches/+ and add your patches
-   for each package in a subdirectory named after the package. Each
-   patch should be called +<packagename>-<num>-<description>.patch+.
-1. Specifically for the Linux kernel, there also exists the option
-   +BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_PATCH+ with as main advantage that it can also
-   download patches from a URL. If you do not need this,
-   +BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR+ is preferred. U-Boot, Barebox, at91bootstrap
-   and at91bootstrap3 also have separate options, but these do not
-   provide any advantage over +BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR+ and will likely be
-   removed in the future.
-1. If you need to add project-specific packages, create
-   +package/<manufacturer>/+ and place your packages in that
-   directory. Create an overall +<manufacturer>.mk+ file that
-   includes the +.mk+ files of all your packages. Create an overall
-   +Config.in+ file that sources the +Config.in+ files of all your
-   packages. Include this +Config.in+ file from Buildroot's
-   +package/Config.in+ file.
-1. +make savedefconfig+ to save the buildroot configuration.
-1. +cp defconfig configs/<boardname>_defconfig+

-[[rootfs-custom]]
-=== Customizing the generated target filesystem
-
-Besides changing the configuration through +make *config+,
-there are a few other ways to customize the resulting target filesystem.
-
-The two recommended methods, which can co-exist, are root filesystem
-overlay(s) and post build script(s).
-
-Root filesystem overlays (+BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY+)::
-+
-A filesystem overlay is a tree of files that is copied directly
-  over the target filesystem after it has been built. To enable this
-  feature, set config option +BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY+ (in the +System
-  configuration+ menu) to the root of the overlay. You can even specify
-  multiple overlays, space-separated. If you specify a relative path,
-  it will be relative to the root of the Buildroot tree. Hidden
-  directories of version control systems, like +.git+, +.svn+, +.hg+,
-  etc., files called +.empty+ and files ending in +~+ are excluded from
-  the copy.
-+
-When +BR2_ROOTFS_MERGED_USR+ is enabled, then the overlay must not
-  contain the '/bin', '/lib' or '/sbin' directories, as Buildroot will
-  create them as symbolic links to the relevant folders in '/usr'.  In
-  such a situation, should the overlay have any programs or libraries,
-  they should be placed in '/usr/bin', '/usr/sbin' and '/usr/lib'.
-+
-As shown in xref:customize-dir-structure[], the recommended path for
-  this overlay is +board/<company>/<boardname>/rootfs-overlay+.
-
-Post-build scripts (+BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT+)::
-+
-Post-build scripts are shell scripts called 'after' Buildroot builds
-  all the selected software, but 'before' the rootfs images are
-  assembled. To enable this feature, specify a space-separated list of
-  post-build scripts in config option +BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT+ (in
-  the +System configuration+ menu). If you specify a relative path, it
-  will be relative to the root of the Buildroot tree.
-+
-Using post-build scripts, you can remove or modify any file in your
-  target filesystem. You should, however, use this feature with care.
-  Whenever you find that a certain package generates wrong or unneeded
-  files, you should fix that package rather than work around it with some
-  post-build cleanup scripts.
-+
-As shown in xref:customize-dir-structure[], the recommended path for
-  this script is +board/<company>/<boardname>/post_build.sh+.
-+
-The post-build scripts are run with the main Buildroot tree as current
-  working directory. The path to the target filesystem is passed as the
-  first argument to each script. If the config option
-  +BR2_ROOTFS_POST_SCRIPT_ARGS+ is not empty, these arguments will be
-  passed to the script too. All the scripts will be passed the exact
-  same set of arguments, it is not possible to pass different sets of
-  arguments to each script.
-+
-In addition, you may also use these environment variables:
-
-  - +BR2_CONFIG+: the path to the Buildroot .config file
-  - +CONFIG_DIR+: the directory containing the .config file, and
-    therefore the top-level Buildroot Makefile to use (which is
-    correct for both in-tree and out-of-tree builds)
-  - +HOST_DIR+, +STAGING_DIR+, +TARGET_DIR+: see
-    xref:generic-package-reference[]
-  - +BUILD_DIR+: the directory where packages are extracted and built
-  - +BINARIES_DIR+: the place where all binary files (aka images) are
-    stored
-  - +BASE_DIR+: the base output directory
-
-Below three more methods of customizing the target filesystem are
-described, but they are not recommended.
-
-Direct modification of the target filesystem::
-+
-For temporary modifications, you can modify the target filesystem
-  directly and rebuild the image. The target filesystem is available
-  under +output/target/+. After making your changes, run +make+ to
-  rebuild the target filesystem image.
-+
-This method allows you to do anything to the target filesystem, but if
-  you need to clean your Buildroot tree using +make clean+, these
-  changes will be lost. Such cleaning is necessary in several cases,
-  refer to xref:full-rebuild[] for details. This solution is therefore
-  only useful for quick tests: _changes do not survive the +make clean+
-  command_. Once you have validated your changes, you should make sure
-  that they will persist after a +make clean+, using a root filesystem
-  overlay or a post-build script.
-
-Custom target skeleton (+BR2_ROOTFS_SKELETON_CUSTOM+)::
-+
-The root filesystem image is created from a target skeleton, on top of
-  which all packages install their files. The skeleton is copied to the
-  target directory +output/target+ before any package is built and
-  installed. The default target skeleton provides the standard Unix
-  filesystem layout and some basic init scripts and configuration files.
-+
-If the default skeleton (available under +system/skeleton+) does not
-  match your needs, you would typically use a root filesystem overlay or
-  post-build script to adapt it. However, if the default skeleton is
-  entirely different than what you need, using a custom skeleton may be
-  more suitable.
-+
-To enable this feature, enable config option
-  +BR2_ROOTFS_SKELETON_CUSTOM+ and set +BR2_ROOTFS_SKELETON_CUSTOM_PATH+
-  to the path of your custom skeleton. Both options are available in the
-  +System configuration+ menu. If you specify a relative path, it will
-  be relative to the root of the Buildroot tree.
-+
-Custom skeletons don't need to contain the '/bin', '/lib' or '/sbin'
-  directories, since they are created automatically during the build.
-  When +BR2_ROOTFS_MERGED_USR+ is enabled, then the custom skeleton must
-  not contain the '/bin', '/lib' or '/sbin' directories, as Buildroot
-  will create them as symbolic links to the relevant folders in '/usr'.
-  In such a situation, should the skeleton have any programs or
-  libraries, they should be placed in '/usr/bin', '/usr/sbin' and
-  '/usr/lib'.
-+
-This method is not recommended because it duplicates the entire
-  skeleton, which prevents taking advantage of the fixes or improvements
-  brought to the default skeleton in later Buildroot releases.
-
-Post-fakeroot scripts (+BR2_ROOTFS_POST_FAKEROOT_SCRIPT+)::
-+
-When aggregating the final images, some parts of the process requires
-  root rights: creating device nodes in `/dev`, setting permissions or
-  ownership to files and directories... To avoid requiring actual root
-  rights, Buildroot uses +fakeroot+ to simulate root rights. This is not
-  a complete substitute for actually being root, but is enough for what
-  Buildroot needs.
-+
-Post-fakeroot scripts are shell scripts that are called at the 'end' of
-  the fakeroot phase, 'right before' the filesystem image generator is
-  called. As such, they are called in the fakeroot context.
-+
-Post-fakeroot scripts can be useful in case you need to tweak the
-  filesystem to do modifications that are usually only available to the
-  root user.
-+
-.Note:
-It is recommended to use the existing mechanisms to set file permissions
-  or create entries in `/dev` (see xref:customize-device-permission[]) or
-  to create users (see xref:customize-users[])
-+
-.Note:
-The difference between post-build scripts (above) and fakeroot scripts,
-  is that post-build scripts are not called in the fakeroot context.
-+
-.Note:
-Using `fakeroot` is not an absolute substitute for actually being root.
-  `fakeroot` only ever fakes the file access rights and types (regular,
-  block-or-char device...) and uid/gid; these are emulated in-memory.

-[[customize]]
-== Project-specific customization
-
-Typical actions you may need to perform for a given project are:
-
-* configuring Buildroot (including build options and toolchain,
-  bootloader, kernel, package and filesystem image type selection)
-* configuring other components, like the Linux kernel and BusyBox
-* customizing the generated target filesystem
-  ** adding or overwriting files on the target filesystem (using
-     +BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY+)
-  ** modifying or deleting files on the target filesystem (using
-     +BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT+)
-  ** running arbitrary commands prior to generating the filesystem image
-     (using +BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT+)
-  ** setting file permissions and ownership (using
-     +BR2_ROOTFS_DEVICE_TABLE+)
-  ** adding custom devices nodes (using
-     +BR2_ROOTFS_STATIC_DEVICE_TABLE+)
-* adding custom user accounts (using +BR2_ROOTFS_USERS_TABLES+)
-* running arbitrary commands after generating the filesystem image
-  (using +BR2_ROOTFS_POST_IMAGE_SCRIPT+)
-* adding project-specific patches to some packages (using
-  +BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR+)
-* adding project-specific packages
-
-An important note regarding such 'project-specific' customizations:
-please carefully consider which changes are indeed project-specific and
-which changes are also useful to developers outside your project. The
-Buildroot community highly recommends and encourages the upstreaming of
-improvements, packages and board support to the official Buildroot
-project. Of course, it is sometimes not possible or desirable to
-upstream because the changes are highly specific or proprietary.
-
-This chapter describes how to make such project-specific customizations
-in Buildroot and how to store them in a way that you can build the same
-image in a reproducible way, even after running 'make clean'. By
-following the recommended strategy, you can even use the same Buildroot
-tree to build multiple distinct projects!

-== Debugging Buildroot
-
-It is possible to instrument the steps +Buildroot+ does when building
-packages. Define the variable +BR2_INSTRUMENTATION_SCRIPTS+ to contain
-the path of one or more scripts (or other executables), in a
-space-separated list, you want called before and after each step. The

-
-  - +start+ or +end+ to denote the start (resp. the end) of a step;
-  - the name of the step about to be started, or which just ended;
-  - the name of the package.
-
-For example :
-
-----
-make BR2_INSTRUMENTATION_SCRIPTS="/path/to/my/script1 /path/to/my/script2"
-----
-
-The list of steps is:
-
-  - +extract+

-== DEVELOPERS file and get-developers
-
-The main Buildroot directory contains a file named +DEVELOPERS+ that
-lists the developers involved with various areas of Buildroot. Thanks
-to this file, the +get-developers+ tool allows to:
-
-- Calculate the list of developers to whom patches should be sent, by
-  parsing the patches and matching the modified files with the
-  relevant developers. See xref:submitting-patches[] for details.
-
-- Find which developers are taking care of a given architecture or
-  package, so that they can be notified when a build failure occurs on
-  this architecture or package. This is done in interaction with
-  Buildroot's autobuild infrastructure.
-
-We ask developers adding new packages, new boards, or generally new
-functionality in Buildroot, to register themselves in the +DEVELOPERS+
-file. As an example, we expect a developer contributing a new package
-to include in his patch the appropriate modification to the
-+DEVELOPERS+ file.
-
-The +DEVELOPERS+ file format is documented in detail inside the file
-itself.
-
-The +get-developers+ tool, located in +utils/+ allows to use
-the +DEVELOPERS+ file for various tasks:
-
-- When passing one or several patches as command line argument,
-  +get-developers+ will return the appropriate +git send-email+
-  command. If the +-e+ option is passed, only the email addresses are
-  printed in a format suitable for +git send-email --cc-cmd+.
-
-- When using the +-a <arch>+ command line option, +get-developers+ will
-  return the list of developers in charge of the given architecture.
-
-- When using the +-p <package>+ command line option, +get-developers+
-  will return the list of developers in charge of the given package.
-
-- When using the +-c+ command line option, +get-developers+ will look
-  at all files under version control in the Buildroot repository, and
-  list the ones that are not handled by any developer. The purpose of
-  this option is to help completing the +DEVELOPERS+ file.
-
-- When using without any arguments, it validates the integrity of the
-  DEVELOPERS file and will note WARNINGS for items that don't match.

-==== Location of downloaded packages
-
-The various tarballs that are downloaded by Buildroot are all stored
-in +BR2_DL_DIR+, which by default is the +dl+ directory. If you want
-to keep a complete version of Buildroot which is known to be working
-with the associated tarballs, you can make a copy of this directory.
-This will allow you to regenerate the toolchain and the target
-filesystem with exactly the same versions.
-
-If you maintain several Buildroot trees, it might be better to have a
-shared download location. This can be achieved by pointing the
-+BR2_DL_DIR+ environment variable to a directory. If this is
-set, then the value of +BR2_DL_DIR+ in the Buildroot configuration is
-overridden. The following line should be added to +<~/.bashrc>+.
-
------------------
- export BR2_DL_DIR=<shared download location>
------------------
-
-The download location can also be set in the +.config+ file, with the
-+BR2_DL_DIR+ option. Unlike most options in the .config file, this value
-is overridden by the +BR2_DL_DIR+ environment variable.

-=== Integration with Eclipse
-
-While a part of the embedded Linux developers like classical text
-editors like Vim or Emacs, and command-line based interfaces, a number
-of other embedded Linux developers like richer graphical interfaces to
-do their development work. Eclipse being one of the most popular
-Integrated Development Environment, Buildroot integrates with Eclipse
-in order to ease the development work of Eclipse users.
-
-Our integration with Eclipse simplifies the compilation, remote
-execution and remote debugging of applications and libraries that are
-built on top of a Buildroot system. It does not integrate the
-Buildroot configuration and build processes themselves with
-Eclipse. Therefore, the typical usage model of our Eclipse integration
-would be:
-
-* Configure your Buildroot system with +make menuconfig+, +make
-  xconfig+ or any other configuration interface provided with
-  Buildroot.
-* Build your Buildroot system by running +make+.
-* Start Eclipse to develop, execute and debug your own custom
-  applications and libraries, that will rely on the libraries built
-  and installed by Buildroot.
-
-The Buildroot Eclipse integration installation process and usage is
-described in detail at
-https://github.com/mbats/eclipse-buildroot-bundle/wiki.

-== Frequently Asked Questions & Troubleshooting
-
-[[faq-boot-hang-after-starting]]
-=== The boot hangs after 'Starting network...'
-
-If the boot process seems to hang after the following messages
-(messages not necessarily exactly similar, depending on the list of
-packages selected):
-
-------------------------
-Freeing init memory: 3972K
-Initializing random number generator... done.
-Starting network...
-Starting dropbear sshd: generating rsa key... generating dsa key... OK
-------------------------
-
-then it means that your system is running, but didn't start a shell on
-the serial console. In order to have the system start a shell on your
-serial console, you have to go into the Buildroot configuration, in
-+System configuration+, modify +Run a getty (login prompt) after boot+
-and set the appropriate port and baud rate in the +getty options+
-submenu. This will automatically tune the +/etc/inittab+ file of the
-generated system so that a shell starts on the correct serial port.
-
-[[faq-no-compiler-on-target]]
-=== Why is there no compiler on the target?
-
-It has been decided that support for the _native compiler on the
-target_ would be stopped from the Buildroot-2012.11 release because:
-
-* this feature was neither maintained nor tested, and often broken;
-* this feature was only available for Buildroot toolchains;
-* Buildroot mostly targets _small_ or _very small_ target hardware
-  with limited resource onboard (CPU, ram, mass-storage), for which
-  compiling on the target does not make much sense;
-* Buildroot aims at easing the cross-compilation, making native
-  compilation on the target unnecessary.
-
-If you need a compiler on your target anyway, then Buildroot is not
-suitable for your purpose. In such case, you need a _real
-distribution_ and you should opt for something like:
-
-* http://www.openembedded.org[openembedded]
-* https://www.yoctoproject.org[yocto]
-* http://www.emdebian.org[emdebian]
-* https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures[Fedora]
-* http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM[openSUSE ARM]
-* http://archlinuxarm.org[Arch Linux ARM]
-* ...
-
-[[faq-no-dev-files-on-target]]
-=== Why are there no development files on the target?
-
-Since there is no compiler available on the target (see
-xref:faq-no-compiler-on-target[]), it does not make sense to waste
-space with headers or static libraries.
-
-Therefore, those files are always removed from the target since the
-Buildroot-2012.11 release.
-
-[[faq-no-doc-on-target]]
-=== Why is there no documentation on the target?
-
-Because Buildroot mostly targets _small_ or _very small_ target
-hardware with limited resource onboard (CPU, ram, mass-storage), it
-does not make sense to waste space with the documentation data.
-
-If you need documentation data on your target anyway, then Buildroot
-is not suitable for your purpose, and you should look for a _real
-distribution_ (see: xref:faq-no-compiler-on-target[]).
-
-[[faq-why-not-visible-package]]
-=== Why are some packages not visible in the Buildroot config menu?
-
-If a package exists in the Buildroot tree and does not appear in the
-config menu, this most likely means that some of the package's
-dependencies are not met.
-
-To know more about the dependencies of a package, search for the
-package symbol in the config menu (see xref:make-tips[]).
-
-Then, you may have to recursively enable several options (which
-correspond to the unmet dependencies) to finally be able to select
-the package.
-
-If the package is not visible due to some unmet toolchain options,
-then you should certainly run a full rebuild (see xref:make-tips[] for
-more explanations).
-
-[[faq-why-not-use-target-as-chroot]]
-=== Why not use the target directory as a chroot directory?
-
-There are plenty of reasons to *not* use the target directory a chroot
-one, among these:
-
-* file ownerships, modes and permissions are not correctly set in the
-  target directory;
-* device nodes are not created in the target directory.
-
-For these reasons, commands run through chroot, using the target
-directory as the new root, will most likely fail.
-
-If you want to run the target filesystem inside a chroot, or as an NFS
-root, then use the tarball image generated in +images/+ and extract it
-as root.
-
-[[faq-no-binary-packages]]
-=== Why doesn't Buildroot generate binary packages (.deb, .ipkg...)?
-
-One feature that is often discussed on the Buildroot list is the
-general topic of "package management". To summarize, the idea
-would be to add some tracking of which Buildroot package installs
-what files, with the goals of:
-
- * being able to remove files installed by a package when this package
-   gets unselected from the menuconfig;
-
- * being able to generate binary packages (ipk or other format) that
-   can be installed on the target without re-generating a new root
-   filesystem image.
-
-In general, most people think it is easy to do: just track which package
-installed what and remove it when the package is unselected. However, it
-is much more complicated than that:
-
- * It is not only about the +target/+ directory, but also the sysroot in
-   +host/<tuple>/sysroot+ and the +host/+ directory itself. All files
-   installed in those directories by various packages must be tracked.
-
- * When a package is unselected from the configuration, it is not
-   sufficient to remove just the files it installed. One must also
-   remove all its reverse dependencies (i.e. packages relying on it)
-   and rebuild all those packages. For example, package A depends
-   optionally on the OpenSSL library. Both are selected, and Buildroot
-   is built. Package A is built with crypto support using OpenSSL.
-   Later on, OpenSSL gets unselected from the configuration, but
-   package A remains (since OpenSSL is an optional dependency, this
-   is possible.) If only OpenSSL files are removed, then the files
-   installed by package A are broken: they use a library that is no
-   longer present on the target. Although this is technically doable,
-   it adds a lot of complexity to Buildroot, which goes against the
-   simplicity we try to stick to.
-
- * In addition to the previous problem, there is the case where the
-   optional dependency is not even known to Buildroot. For example,
-   package A in version 1.0 never used OpenSSL, but in version 2.0 it
-   automatically uses OpenSSL if available. If the Buildroot .mk file
-   hasn't been updated to take this into account, then package A will
-   not be part of the reverse dependencies of OpenSSL and will not be
-   removed and rebuilt when OpenSSL is removed. For sure, the .mk file
-   of package A should be fixed to mention this optional dependency,
-   but in the mean time, you can have non-reproducible behaviors.
-
- * The request is to also allow changes in the menuconfig to be
-   applied on the output directory without having to rebuild
-   everything from scratch. However, this is very difficult to achieve
-   in a reliable way: what happens when the suboptions of a package
-   are changed (we would have to detect this, and rebuild the package
-   from scratch and potentially all its reverse dependencies), what
-   happens if toolchain options are changed, etc. At the moment, what
-   Buildroot does is clear and simple so its behaviour is very
-   reliable and it is easy to support users. If configuration changes
-   done in menuconfig are applied after the next make, then it has to
-   work correctly and properly in all situations, and not have some
-   bizarre corner cases. The risk is to get bug reports like "I have
-   enabled package A, B and C, then ran make, then disabled package
-   C and enabled package D and ran make, then re-enabled package C
-   and enabled package E and then there is a build failure". Or worse
-   "I did some configuration, then built, then did some changes,
-   built, some more changes, built, some more changes, built, and now
-   it fails, but I don't remember all the changes I did and in which
-   order". This will be impossible to support.
-
-For all these reasons, the conclusion is that adding tracking of
-installed files to remove them when the package is unselected, or to
-generate a repository of binary packages, is something that is very
-hard to achieve reliably and will add a lot of complexity.
-
-On this matter, the Buildroot developers make this position statement:
-
- * Buildroot strives to make it easy to generate a root filesystem (hence
-   the name, by the way.) That is what we want to make Buildroot good at:
-   building root filesystems.
-
- * Buildroot is not meant to be a distribution (or rather, a distribution
-   generator.) It is the opinion of most Buildroot developers that this
-   is not a goal we should pursue. We believe that there are other tools
-   better suited to generate a distro than Buildroot is. For example,
-   http://openembedded.org/[Open Embedded], or https://openwrt.org/[openWRT],
-   are such tools.
-
- * We prefer to push Buildroot in a direction that makes it easy (or even
-   easier) to generate complete root filesystems. This is what makes
-   Buildroot stands out in the crowd (among other things, of course!)
-
- * We believe that for most embedded Linux systems, binary packages are
-   not necessary, and potentially harmful. When binary packages are
-   used, it means that the system can be partially upgraded, which
-   creates an enormous number of possible combinations of package
-   versions that should be tested before doing the upgrade on the
-   embedded device. On the other hand, by doing complete system
-   upgrades by upgrading the entire root filesystem image at once,
-   the image deployed to the embedded system is guaranteed to really
-   be the one that has been tested and validated.
-
-[[faq-speeding-up-build]]
-=== How to speed-up the build process?
-
-Since Buildroot often involves doing full rebuilds of the entire
-system that can be quite long, we provide below a number of tips to
-help reduce the build time:
-
- * Use a pre-built external toolchain instead of the default Buildroot
-   internal toolchain. By using a pre-built Linaro toolchain (on ARM)
-   or a Sourcery CodeBench toolchain (for ARM, x86, x86-64, MIPS,
-   etc.), you will save the build time of the toolchain at each
-   complete rebuild, approximately 15 to 20 minutes. Note that
-   temporarily using an external toolchain does not prevent you to
-   switch back to an internal toolchain (that may provide a higher
-   level of customization) once the rest of your system is working;
-
- * Use the +ccache+ compiler cache (see: xref:ccache[]);
-
- * Learn about rebuilding only the few packages you actually care
-   about (see xref:rebuild-pkg[]), but beware that sometimes full
-   rebuilds are anyway necessary (see xref:full-rebuild[]);
-
- * Make sure you are not using a virtual machine for the Linux system
-   used to run Buildroot. Most of the virtual machine technologies are
-   known to cause a significant performance impact on I/O, which is
-   really important for building source code;
-
- * Make sure that you're using only local files: do not attempt to do
-   a build over NFS, which significantly slows down the build. Having
-   the Buildroot download folder available locally also helps a bit.
-
- * Buy new hardware. SSDs and lots of RAM are key to speeding up the
-   builds.
-
- * Experiment with top-level parallel build, see
-   xref:top-level-parallel-build[].

-== How Buildroot works
-
-As mentioned above, Buildroot is basically a set of Makefiles that
-download, configure, and compile software with the correct options. It
-also includes patches for various software packages - mainly the ones
-involved in the cross-compilation toolchain (+gcc+, +binutils+ and
-+uClibc+).
-
-There is basically one Makefile per software package, and they are
-named with the +.mk+ extension. Makefiles are split into many different
-parts.
-
-* The +toolchain/+ directory contains the Makefiles
-  and associated files for all software related to the
-  cross-compilation toolchain: +binutils+, +gcc+, +gdb+,
-  +kernel-headers+ and +uClibc+.
-
-* The +arch/+ directory contains the definitions for all the processor
-  architectures that are supported by Buildroot.
-
-* The +package/+ directory contains the Makefiles and
-  associated files for all user-space tools and libraries that Buildroot
-  can compile and add to the target root filesystem. There is one
-  sub-directory per package.
-
-* The +linux/+ directory contains the Makefiles and associated files for
-  the Linux kernel.
-
-* The +boot/+ directory contains the Makefiles and associated files for
-  the bootloaders supported by Buildroot.
-
-* The +system/+ directory contains support for system integration, e.g.
-  the target filesystem skeleton and the selection of an init system.
-
-* The +fs/+ directory contains the Makefiles and
-  associated files for software related to the generation of the
-  target root filesystem image.
-
-Each directory contains at least 2 files:
-
-* +something.mk+ is the Makefile that downloads, configures,
-  compiles and installs the package +something+.
-
-* +Config.in+ is a part of the configuration tool
-  description file. It describes the options related to the
-  package.
-
-The main Makefile performs the following steps (once the
-configuration is done):
-
-* Create all the output directories: +staging+, +target+, +build+,
-  etc. in the output directory (+output/+ by default,
-  another value can be specified using +O=+)
-
-* Generate the toolchain target. When an internal toolchain is used, this
-  means generating the cross-compilation toolchain. When an external
-  toolchain is used, this means checking the features of the external
-  toolchain and importing it into the Buildroot environment.
-
-* Generate all the targets listed in the +TARGETS+ variable. This
-  variable is filled by all the individual components'
-  Makefiles. Generating these targets will trigger the compilation of
-  the userspace packages (libraries, programs), the kernel, the
-  bootloader and the generation of the root filesystem images,
-  depending on the configuration.

-== About Buildroot
-
-Buildroot is a tool that simplifies and automates the process of
-building a complete Linux system for an embedded system, using
-cross-compilation.
-
-In order to achieve this, Buildroot is able to generate a
-cross-compilation toolchain, a root filesystem, a Linux kernel image
-and a bootloader for your target. Buildroot can be used for any
-combination of these options, independently (you can for example use
-an existing cross-compilation toolchain, and build only your root
-filesystem with Buildroot).
-
-Buildroot is useful mainly for people working with embedded systems.
-Embedded systems often use processors that are not the regular x86
-processors everyone is used to having in his PC. They can be PowerPC
-processors, MIPS processors, ARM processors, etc.
-
-Buildroot supports numerous processors and their variants; it also
-comes with default configurations for several boards available
-off-the-shelf. Besides this, a number of third-party projects are based on,

-== Legal notice and licensing
-
-=== Complying with open source licenses
-
-All of the end products of Buildroot (toolchain, root filesystem, kernel,
-bootloaders) contain open source software, released under various licenses.
-
-Using open source software gives you the freedom to build rich embedded
-systems, choosing from a wide range of packages, but also imposes some
-obligations that you must know and honour.
-Some licenses require you to publish the license text in the documentation of
-your product. Others require you to redistribute the source code of the
-software to those that receive your product.
-
-The exact requirements of each license are documented in each package, and
-it is your responsibility (or that of your legal office) to comply with those
-requirements.
-To make this easier for you, Buildroot can collect for you some material you
-will probably need. To produce this material, after you have configured
-Buildroot with +make menuconfig+, +make xconfig+ or +make gconfig+, run:
-
---------------------
-make legal-info
---------------------
-
-Buildroot will collect legally-relevant material in your output directory,
-under the +legal-info/+ subdirectory.
-There you will find:
-
-* A +README+ file, that summarizes the produced material and contains warnings
-  about material that Buildroot could not produce.
-* +buildroot.config+: this is the Buildroot configuration file that is usually
-  produced with +make menuconfig+, and which is necessary to reproduce the
-  build.
-* The source code for all packages; this is saved in the +sources/+ and
-  +host-sources/+ subdirectories for target and host packages respectively.
-  The source code for packages that set +<PKG>_REDISTRIBUTE = NO+ will not be
-  saved.
-  Patches that were applied are also saved, along with a file named +series+
-  that lists the patches in the order they were applied. Patches are under the
-  same license as the files that they modify.
-  Note: Buildroot applies additional patches to Libtool scripts of
-  autotools-based packages. These patches can be found under
-  +support/libtool+ in the Buildroot source and, due to technical
-  limitations, are not saved with the package sources. You may need to
-  collect them manually.
-* A manifest file (one for host and one for target packages) listing the
-  configured packages, their version, license and related information.
-  Some of this information might not be defined in Buildroot; such items are
-  marked as "unknown".
-* The license texts of all packages, in the +licenses/+ and +host-licenses/+
-  subdirectories for target and host packages respectively.
-  If the license file(s) are not defined in Buildroot, the file is not produced
-  and a warning in the +README+ indicates this.
-
-Please note that the aim of the +legal-info+ feature of Buildroot is to
-produce all the material that is somehow relevant for legal compliance with the
-package licenses. Buildroot does not try to produce the exact material that
-you must somehow make public. Certainly, more material is produced than is
-needed for a strict legal compliance. For example, it produces the source code
-for packages released under BSD-like licenses, that you are not required to
-redistribute in source form.
-
-Moreover, due to technical limitations, Buildroot does not produce some
-material that you will or may need, such as the toolchain source code for
-some of the external toolchains and the Buildroot source code itself.
-When you run +make legal-info+, Buildroot produces warnings in the +README+
-file to inform you of relevant material that could not be saved.
-
-Finally, keep in mind that the output of +make legal-info+ is based on
-declarative statements in each of the packages recipes. The Buildroot
-developers try to do their best to keep those declarative statements as
-accurate as possible, to the best of their knowledge. However, it is very
-well possible that those declarative statements are not all fully accurate
-nor exhaustive. You (or your legal department) _have_ to check the output
-of +make legal-info+ before using it as your own compliance delivery. See
-the _NO WARRANTY_ clauses (clauses 11 and 12) in the +COPYING+ file at the
-root of the Buildroot distribution.
-
-[[legal-info-buildroot]]
-=== Complying with the Buildroot license
-
-Buildroot itself is an open source software, released under the
-http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html[GNU General
-Public License, version 2] or (at your option) any later version, with
-the exception of the package patches detailed below.
-However, being a build system, it is not normally part of the end product:
-if you develop the root filesystem, kernel, bootloader or toolchain for a
-device, the code of Buildroot is only present on the development machine, not
-in the device storage.
-
-Nevertheless, the general view of the Buildroot developers is that you should
-release the Buildroot source code along with the source code of other packages
-when releasing a product that contains GPL-licensed software.
-This is because the
-http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html[GNU GPL]
-defines the "'complete source code'" for an executable work as "'all the
-source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
-definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
-of the executable'".
-Buildroot is part of the 'scripts used to control compilation and
-installation of the executable', and as such it is considered part of the
-material that must be redistributed.
-
-Keep in mind that this is only the Buildroot developers' opinion, and you
-should consult your legal department or lawyer in case of any doubt.
-
-==== Patches to packages
-
-Buildroot also bundles patch files, which are applied to the sources
-of the various packages. Those patches are not covered by the license
-of Buildroot. Instead, they are covered by the license of the software
-to which the patches are applied. When said software is available
-under multiple licenses, the Buildroot patches are only provided under
-the publicly accessible licenses.
-
-See xref:patch-policy[] for the technical details.

-This is a collection of tips that help you make the most of Buildroot.
-
-.Display all commands executed by make:
-
---------------------
- $ make V=1 <target>
---------------------
-
-.Display the list of boards with a defconfig:
-
---------------------
- $ make list-defconfigs
---------------------
-
-.Display all available targets:
-
---------------------
- $ make help
---------------------
-
-Not all targets are always available,
-some settings in the +.config+ file may hide some targets:
-
-* +busybox-menuconfig+ only works when +busybox+ is enabled;
-* +linux-menuconfig+ and +linux-savedefconfig+ only work when
-  +linux+ is enabled;
-* +uclibc-menuconfig+ is only available when the uClibc C library is
-  selected in the internal toolchain backend;
-* +barebox-menuconfig+ and +barebox-savedefconfig+ only work when the
-  +barebox+ bootloader is enabled.
-* +uboot-menuconfig+ and +uboot-savedefconfig+ only work when the
-  +U-Boot+ bootloader is enabled.
-
-.Cleaning:
-
-Explicit cleaning is required when any of the architecture or toolchain
-configuration options are changed.
-
-To delete all build products (including build directories, host, staging
-and target trees, the images and the toolchain):
-
---------------------
- $ make clean
---------------------
-
-.Generating the manual:
-
-The present manual sources are located in the 'docs/manual' directory.
-To generate the manual:
-
----------------------------------
- $ make manual-clean
- $ make manual
----------------------------------
-
-The manual outputs will be generated in 'output/docs/manual'.
-
-.Notes
-- A few tools are required to build the documentation (see:
-  xref:requirement-optional[]).
-
-.Resetting Buildroot for a new target:
-
-To delete all build products as well as the configuration:
-
---------------------
- $ make distclean
---------------------
-
-.Notes
-If +ccache+ is enabled, running +make clean+ or +distclean+ does
-not empty the compiler cache used by Buildroot. To delete it, refer
-to xref:ccache[].
-
-.Dumping the internal make variables:
-
-One can dump the variables known to make, along with their values:
-
-----
- $ make -s printvars VARS='VARIABLE1 VARIABLE2'
- VARIABLE1=value_of_variable
- VARIABLE2=value_of_variable
-----
-
-It is possible to tweak the output using some variables:
-
-- +VARS+ will limit the listing to variables which names match the
-  specified make-patterns - this must be set else nothing is printed
-- +QUOTED_VARS+, if set to +YES+, will single-quote the value
-- +RAW_VARS+, if set to +YES+, will print the unexpanded value
-
-For example:
-
-----
- $ make -s printvars VARS=BUSYBOX_%DEPENDENCIES
- BUSYBOX_DEPENDENCIES=skeleton toolchain
- BUSYBOX_FINAL_ALL_DEPENDENCIES=skeleton toolchain
- BUSYBOX_FINAL_DEPENDENCIES=skeleton toolchain
- BUSYBOX_FINAL_PATCH_DEPENDENCIES=
- BUSYBOX_RDEPENDENCIES=ncurses util-linux
-----
-
-----
- $ make -s printvars VARS=BUSYBOX_%DEPENDENCIES QUOTED_VARS=YES
- BUSYBOX_DEPENDENCIES='skeleton toolchain'
- BUSYBOX_FINAL_ALL_DEPENDENCIES='skeleton toolchain'
- BUSYBOX_FINAL_DEPENDENCIES='skeleton toolchain'
- BUSYBOX_FINAL_PATCH_DEPENDENCIES=''
- BUSYBOX_RDEPENDENCIES='ncurses util-linux'
-----
-
-----
- $ make -s printvars VARS=BUSYBOX_%DEPENDENCIES RAW_VARS=YES
- BUSYBOX_DEPENDENCIES=skeleton toolchain
- BUSYBOX_FINAL_ALL_DEPENDENCIES=$(sort $(BUSYBOX_FINAL_DEPENDENCIES) $(BUSYBOX_FINAL_PATCH_DEPENDENCIES))
- BUSYBOX_FINAL_DEPENDENCIES=$(sort $(BUSYBOX_DEPENDENCIES))
- BUSYBOX_FINAL_PATCH_DEPENDENCIES=$(sort $(BUSYBOX_PATCH_DEPENDENCIES))
- BUSYBOX_RDEPENDENCIES=ncurses util-linux
-----
-
-The output of quoted variables can be reused in shell scripts, for example:
-
-----
- $ eval $(make -s printvars VARS=BUSYBOX_DEPENDENCIES QUOTED_VARS=YES)
- $ echo $BUSYBOX_DEPENDENCIES
- skeleton toolchain

-== Makedev syntax documentation
-
-The makedev syntax is used in several places in Buildroot to
-define changes to be made for permissions, or which device files to
-create and how to create them, in order to avoid calls to mknod.
-
-This syntax is derived from the makedev utility, and more complete
-documentation can be found in the +package/makedevs/README+ file.
-
-It takes the form of a space separated list of fields, one file per
-line; the fields are:
-
-|===========================================================
-|name |type |mode |uid |gid |major |minor |start |inc |count
-|===========================================================
-
-There are a few non-trivial blocks:
-
-- +name+ is the path to the file you want to create/modify
-- +type+ is the type of the file, being one of:
-  * f: a regular file
-  * d: a directory
-  * r: a directory recursively
-  * c: a character device file
-  * b: a block device file
-  * p: a named pipe
-- +mode+ are the usual permissions settings (only numerical values
-  are allowed)
-- +uid+ and +gid+ are the UID and GID to set on this file; can be
-  either numerical values or actual names
-- +major+ and +minor+ are here for device files, set to +-+ for other
-  files
-- +start+, +inc+ and +count+ are for when you want to create a batch
-  of files, and can be reduced to a loop, beginning at +start+,
-  incrementing its counter by +inc+ until it reaches +count+
-
-Let's say you want to change the permissions of a given file; using
-this syntax, you will need to write:
-
-----
-/usr/bin/foo f 755 0 0 - - - - -
-/usr/bin/bar f 755 root root - - - - -
-/data/buz f 644 buz-user buz-group - - - - -
-----
-
-Alternatively, if you want to change owner/permission of a directory
-recursively, you can write (to set UID to foo, GID to bar and access
-rights to rwxr-x--- for the directory /usr/share/myapp and all files
-and directories below it):
-
-----
-/usr/share/myapp r 750 foo bar - - - - -
-----
-
-On the other hand, if you want to create the device file +/dev/hda+
-and the corresponding 15 files for the partitions, you will need for
-+/dev/hda+:
-
-----
-/dev/hda b 640 root root 3 0 0 0 -
-----
-
-and then for device files corresponding to the partitions of
-+/dev/hda+, +/dev/hdaX+, +X+ ranging from 1 to 15:
-
-----
-/dev/hda b 640 root root 3 1 1 1 15
-----
-
-Extended attributes are supported if
-+BR2_ROOTFS_DEVICE_TABLE_SUPPORTS_EXTENDED_ATTRIBUTES+ is enabled.
-This is done by adding a line starting with +|xattr+ after
-the line describing the file. Right now, only capability
-is supported as extended attribute.
-
-|=====================
-| \|xattr | capability
-|=====================
-
-- +|xattr+ is a "flag" that indicate an extended attribute
-- +capability+ is a capability to add to the previous file
-
-If you want to add the capability cap_sys_admin to the binary foo,
-you will write :
-
-----
-/usr/bin/foo f 755 root root - - - - -
-|xattr cap_sys_admin+eip
-----
-
-You can add several capabilities to a file by using several +|xattr+ lines.
-If you want to add the capability cap_sys_admin and cap_net_admin to the
-binary foo, you will write :
-
-----
-/usr/bin/foo f 755 root root - - - - -
-|xattr cap_sys_admin+eip
-|xattr cap_net_admin+eip

-== Makeusers syntax documentation
-
-The syntax to create users is inspired by the makedev syntax, above, but
-is specific to Buildroot.
-
-The syntax for adding a user is a space-separated list of fields, one
-user per line; the fields are:
-
-|=================================================================
-|username |uid |group |gid |password |home |shell |groups |comment
-|=================================================================
-
-Where:
-
-- +username+ is the desired user name (aka login name) for the user.
-  It can not be +root+, and must be unique. If set to +-+, then just a
-  group will be created.
-- +uid+ is the desired UID for the user. It must be unique, and not
-  +0+. If set to +-1+, then a unique UID will be computed by Buildroot
-  in the range [1000...1999]
-- +group+ is the desired name for the user's main group. It can not
-  be +root+. If the group does not exist, it will be created.
-- +gid+ is the desired GID for the user's main group. It must be unique,
-  and not +0+. If set to +-1+, and the group does not already exist, then
-  a unique GID will be computed by Buildroot in the range [1000..1999]
-- +password+ is the crypt(3)-encoded password. If prefixed with +!+,
-  then login is disabled. If prefixed with +=+, then it is interpreted
-  as clear-text, and will be crypt-encoded (using MD5). If prefixed with
-  +!=+, then the password will be crypt-encoded (using MD5) and login
-  will be disabled. If set to +*+, then login is not allowed. If set to 
-  +-+, then no password value will be set.
-- +home+ is the desired home directory for the user. If set to '-', no
-  home directory will be created, and the user's home will be +/+.
-  Explicitly setting +home+ to +/+ is not allowed.
-- +shell+ is the desired shell for the user. If set to +-+, then
-  +/bin/false+ is set as the user's shell.
-- +groups+ is the comma-separated list of additional groups the user
-  should be part of. If set to +-+, then the user will be a member of
-  no additional group. Missing groups will be created with an arbitrary
-  +gid+.
-- +comment+ (aka https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecos_field[GECOS]
-  field) is an almost-free-form text.
-
-There are a few restrictions on the content of each field:
-
-* except for +comment+, all fields are mandatory.
-* except for +comment+, fields may not contain spaces.
-* no field may contain a colon (+:+).
-
-If +home+ is not +-+, then the home directory, and all files below,
-will belong to the user and its main group.
-
-Examples:
-
-----
-foo -1 bar -1 !=blabla /home/foo /bin/sh alpha,bravo Foo user
-----
-
-This will create this user:
-
-- +username+ (aka login name) is: +foo+
-- +uid+ is computed by Buildroot
-- main +group+ is: +bar+
-- main group +gid+ is computed by Buildroot
-- clear-text +password+ is: +blabla+, will be crypt(3)-encoded, and login is disabled.
-- +home+ is: +/home/foo+
-- +shell+ is: +/bin/sh+
-- +foo+ is also a member of +groups+: +alpha+ and +bravo+
-- +comment+ is: +Foo user+
-
-----
-test 8000 wheel -1 = - /bin/sh - Test user
-----
-
-This will create this user:
-
-- +username+ (aka login name) is: +test+
-- +uid+ is : +8000+
-- main +group+ is: +wheel+
-- main group +gid+ is computed by Buildroot, and will use the value defined in the rootfs skeleton
-- +password+ is empty (aka no password).
-- +home+ is +/+ but will not belong to +test+
-- +shell+ is: +/bin/sh+
-- +test+ is not a member of any additional +groups+
-- +comment+ is: +Test user+

-building a complete Linux system for an embedded system, using
-cross-compilation.</p><p>In order to achieve this, Buildroot is able to generate a
-cross-compilation toolchain, a root filesystem, a Linux kernel image
-and a bootloader for your target. Buildroot can be used for any
-combination of these options, independently (you can for example use
-an existing cross-compilation toolchain, and build only your root
-filesystem with Buildroot).</p><p>Buildroot is useful mainly for people working with embedded systems.
-Embedded systems often use processors that are not the regular x86
-processors everyone is used to having in his PC. They can be PowerPC
-processors, MIPS processors, ARM processors, etc.</p><p>Buildroot supports numerous processors and their variants; it also
-comes with default configurations for several boards available
-off-the-shelf. Besides this, a number of third-party projects are based on,
-or develop their BSP <a href="#ftn.idm24" class="footnote" id="idm24"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a> or

There
-is no need to be root to configure and use Buildroot. By running all
-commands as a regular user, you protect your system against packages
-behaving badly during compilation and installation.</p><p>The first step when using Buildroot is to create a configuration.
-Buildroot has a nice configuration tool similar to the one you can
-find in the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.kernel.org/" target="_top">Linux kernel</a> or in
-<a class="ulink" href="http://www.busybox.net/" target="_top">BusyBox</a>.</p><p>From the buildroot directory, run</p><pre class="screen"> $ make menuconfig</pre><p>for the original curses-based configurator, or</p><pre class="screen"> $ make nconfig</pre><p>for the new curses-based configurator, or</p><pre class="screen"> $ make xconfig</pre><p>for the Qt-based configurator, or</p><pre class="screen"> $ make gconfig</pre><p>for the GTK-based configurator.</p><p>All of these "make" commands will need to build a configuration
-utility (including the interface), so you may need to install
-"development" packages for relevant libraries used by the
-configuration utilities. Refer to <a class="xref" href="#requirement" title="Chapter2.System requirements">Chapter2, <em>System requirements</em></a> for more details,
-specifically the <a class="link" href="#requirement-optional" title="2.2.Optional packages">optional requirements</a>
-to get the dependencies of your favorite interface.</p><p>For each menu entry in the configuration tool, you can find associated
-help that describes the purpose of the entry. Refer to <a class="xref" href="#configure" title="Chapter6.Buildroot configuration">Chapter6, <em>Buildroot configuration</em></a>
-for details on some specific configuration aspects.</p><p>Once everything is configured, the configuration tool generates a
-<code class="literal">.config</code> file that contains the entire configuration. This file will be
-read by the top-level Makefile.</p><p>To start the build process, simply run:</p><pre class="screen"> $ make</pre><p>By default, Buildroot does not support top-level parallel build, so
-running <code class="literal">make -jN</code> is not necessary. There is however experimental
-support for top-level parallel build, see
-<a class="xref" href="#top-level-parallel-build" title="8.12.Top-level parallel build">Section8.12, Top-level parallel build</a>.</p><p>The <code class="literal">make</code> command will generally perform the following steps:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
-download source files (as required);
-</li><li class="listitem">

-</li><li class="listitem">
-<code class="literal">build/</code> where all the components are built (this includes tools
-  needed by Buildroot on the host and packages compiled for the
-  target). This directory contains one subdirectory for each of these
-  components.
-</li><li class="listitem">
-<code class="literal">host/</code> contains both the tools built for the host, and the sysroot
-  of the target toolchain. The former is an installation of tools
-  compiled for the host that are needed for the proper execution of
-  Buildroot, including the cross-compilation toolchain. The latter
-  is a hierarchy similar to a root filesystem hierarchy. It contains
-  the headers and libraries of all user-space packages that provide
-  and install libraries used by other packages. However, this
-  directory is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> intended to be the root filesystem for the target:
-  it contains a lot of development files, unstripped binaries and
-  libraries that make it far too big for an embedded system. These
-  development files are used to compile libraries and applications for
-  the target that depend on other libraries.
-</li><li class="listitem">
-<code class="literal">staging/</code> is a symlink to the target toolchain sysroot inside
-  <code class="literal">host/</code>, which exists for backwards compatibility.
-</li><li class="listitem">
-<code class="literal">target/</code> which contains <span class="emphasis"><em>almost</em></span> the complete root filesystem for

-  <code class="literal">/dev/</code> (Buildroot cant create them because Buildroot doesnt run
-  as root and doesnt want to run as root). Also, it doesnt have the correct
-  permissions (e.g. setuid for the busybox binary). Therefore, this directory
-  <span class="strong"><strong>should not be used on your target</strong></span>. Instead, you should use one of
-  the images built in the <code class="literal">images/</code> directory. If you need an
-  extracted image of the root filesystem for booting over NFS, then
-  use the tarball image generated in <code class="literal">images/</code> and extract it as
-  root. Compared to <code class="literal">staging/</code>, <code class="literal">target/</code> contains only the files and
-  libraries needed to run the selected target applications: the

-code for your system. It consists of a compiler (in our case, <code class="literal">gcc</code>),
-binary utils like assembler and linker (in our case, <code class="literal">binutils</code>) and a
-C standard library (for example
-<a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html" target="_top">GNU Libc</a>,
-<a class="ulink" href="http://www.uclibc-ng.org/" target="_top">uClibc-ng</a>).</p><p>The system installed on your development station certainly already has
-a compilation toolchain that you can use to compile an application
-that runs on your system. If youre using a PC, your compilation
-toolchain runs on an x86 processor and generates code for an x86
-processor. Under most Linux systems, the compilation toolchain uses
-the GNU libc (glibc) as the C standard library. This compilation
-toolchain is called the "host compilation toolchain". The machine on
-which it is running, and on which youre working, is called the "host
-system" <a href="#ftn.idm361" class="footnote" id="idm361"><sup class="footnote">[3]</sup></a>.</p><p>The compilation toolchain is provided by your distribution, and
-Buildroot has nothing to do with it (other than using it to build a
-cross-compilation toolchain and other tools that are run on the
-development host).</p><p>As said above, the compilation toolchain that comes with your system
-runs on and generates code for the processor in your host system. As
-your embedded system has a different processor, you need a
-cross-compilation toolchain - a compilation toolchain that runs on
-your <span class="emphasis"><em>host system</em></span> but generates code for your <span class="emphasis"><em>target system</em></span> (and
-target processor). For example, if your host system uses x86 and your
-target system uses ARM, the regular compilation toolchain on your host
-runs on x86 and generates code for x86, while the cross-compilation
-toolchain runs on x86 and generates code for ARM.</p><p>Buildroot provides two solutions for the cross-compilation toolchain:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

-Change the version of the Linux kernel headers used to build the
-   toolchain. This item deserves a few explanations. In the process of
-   building a cross-compilation toolchain, the C library is being
-   built. This library provides the interface between userspace
-   applications and the Linux kernel. In order to know how to "talk"
-   to the Linux kernel, the C library needs to have access to the
-   <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux kernel headers</em></span> (i.e. the <code class="literal">.h</code> files from the kernel), which
-   define the interface between userspace and the kernel (system
-   calls, data structures, etc.). Since this interface is backward
-   compatible, the version of the Linux kernel headers used to build
-   your toolchain do not need to match <span class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span> the version of the
-   Linux kernel you intend to run on your embedded system. They only
-   need to have a version equal or older to the version of the Linux
-   kernel you intend to run. If you use kernel headers that are more
-   recent than the Linux kernel you run on your embedded system, then
-   the C library might be using interfaces that are not provided by
-   your Linux kernel.

-Select a number of toolchain options (uClibc only): whether the

-   wide-char support, locale support (for internationalization),
-   C++ support or thread support. Depending on which options you choose,
-   the number of userspace applications and libraries visible in
-   Buildroot menus will change: many applications and libraries require
-   certain toolchain options to be enabled. Most packages show a comment

-Buildroot itself. In general, all toolchains that support the
-<span class="emphasis"><em>sysroot</em></span> feature should work. If not, do not hesitate to contact the
-developers.</p><p>We do not support toolchains or SDK generated by OpenEmbedded or
-Yocto, because these toolchains are not pure toolchains (i.e. just the
-compiler, binutils, the C and C++ libraries). Instead these toolchains
-come with a very large set of pre-compiled libraries and
-programs. Therefore, Buildroot cannot import the <span class="emphasis"><em>sysroot</em></span> of the
-toolchain, as it would contain hundreds of megabytes of pre-compiled
-libraries that are normally built by Buildroot.</p><p>We also do not support using the distribution toolchain (i.e. the
-gcc/binutils/C library installed by your distribution) as the
-toolchain to build software for the target. This is because your
-distribution toolchain is not a "pure" toolchain (i.e. only with the
-C/C++ library), so we cannot import it properly into the Buildroot
-build environment. So even if you are building a system for a x86 or
-x86_64 target, you have to generate a cross-compilation toolchain with
-Buildroot or crosstool-NG.</p><p>If you want to generate a custom toolchain for your project, that can

-<span class="emphasis"><em>device files</em></span>, that allow userspace applications to access the
-hardware devices managed by the Linux kernel. Without these <span class="emphasis"><em>device
-files</em></span>, your userspace applications would not be able to use the
-hardware devices, even if they are properly recognized by the Linux
-kernel.</p><p>Under <code class="literal">System configuration</code>, <code class="literal">/dev management</code>, Buildroot offers four
-different solutions to handle the <code class="literal">/dev</code> directory :</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
-The first solution is <span class="strong"><strong>Static using device table</strong></span>. This is the old
-   classical way of handling device files in Linux. With this method,
-   the device files are persistently stored in the root filesystem
-   (i.e. they persist across reboots), and there is nothing that will
-   automatically create and remove those device files when hardware
-   devices are added or removed from the system. Buildroot therefore
-   creates a standard set of device files using a <span class="emphasis"><em>device table</em></span>, the
-   default one being stored in <code class="literal">system/device_table_dev.txt</code> in the
-   Buildroot source code. This file is processed when Buildroot
-   generates the final root filesystem image, and the <span class="emphasis"><em>device files</em></span>
-   are therefore not visible in the <code class="literal">output/target</code> directory. The
-   <code class="literal">BR2_ROOTFS_STATIC_DEVICE_TABLE</code> option allows to change the
-   default device table used by Buildroot, or to add an additional
-   device table, so that additional <span class="emphasis"><em>device files</em></span> are created by
-   Buildroot during the build. So, if you use this method, and a
-   <span class="emphasis"><em>device file</em></span> is missing in your system, you can for example create
-   a <code class="literal">board/&lt;yourcompany&gt;/&lt;yourproject&gt;/device_table_dev.txt</code> file
-   that contains the description of your additional <span class="emphasis"><em>device files</em></span>,
-   and then you can set <code class="literal">BR2_ROOTFS_STATIC_DEVICE_TABLE</code> to
-   <code class="literal">system/device_table_dev.txt
-   board/&lt;yourcompany&gt;/&lt;yourproject&gt;/device_table_dev.txt</code>. For more
-   details about the format of the device table file, see
-   <a class="xref" href="#makedev-syntax" title="Chapter25.Makedev syntax documentation">Chapter25, <em>Makedev syntax documentation</em></a>.
-</li><li class="listitem">
-The second solution is <span class="strong"><strong>Dynamic using devtmpfs only</strong></span>. <span class="emphasis"><em>devtmpfs</em></span> is
-   a virtual filesystem inside the Linux kernel that has been
-   introduced in kernel 2.6.32 (if you use an older kernel, it is not
-   possible to use this option). When mounted in <code class="literal">/dev</code>, this virtual
-   filesystem will automatically make <span class="emphasis"><em>device files</em></span> appear and
-   disappear as hardware devices are added and removed from the
-   system. This filesystem is not persistent across reboots: it is
-   filled dynamically by the kernel. Using <span class="emphasis"><em>devtmpfs</em></span> requires the
-   following kernel configuration options to be enabled:
-   <code class="literal">CONFIG_DEVTMPFS</code> and <code class="literal">CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT</code>. When Buildroot is in
-   charge of building the Linux kernel for your embedded device, it
-   makes sure that those two options are enabled. However, if you
-   build your Linux kernel outside of Buildroot, then it is your
-   responsibility to enable those two options (if you fail to do so,
-   your Buildroot system will not boot).
-</li><li class="listitem">
-The third solution is <span class="strong"><strong>Dynamic using devtmpfs + mdev</strong></span>. This method
-   also relies on the <span class="emphasis"><em>devtmpfs</em></span> virtual filesystem detailed above (so
-   the requirement to have <code class="literal">CONFIG_DEVTMPFS</code> and
-   <code class="literal">CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT</code> enabled in the kernel configuration still
-   apply), but adds the <code class="literal">mdev</code> userspace utility on top of it. <code class="literal">mdev</code>
-   is a program part of BusyBox that the kernel will call every time a
-   device is added or removed. Thanks to the <code class="literal">/etc/mdev.conf</code>
-   configuration file, <code class="literal">mdev</code> can be configured to for example, set
-   specific permissions or ownership on a device file, call a script
-   or application whenever a device appears or disappear,
-   etc. Basically, it allows <span class="emphasis"><em>userspace</em></span> to react on device addition
-   and removal events. <code class="literal">mdev</code> can for example be used to automatically
-   load kernel modules when devices appear on the system. <code class="literal">mdev</code> is
-   also important if you have devices that require a firmware, as it
-   will be responsible for pushing the firmware contents to the
-   kernel. <code class="literal">mdev</code> is a lightweight implementation (with fewer
-   features) of <code class="literal">udev</code>. For more details about <code class="literal">mdev</code> and the syntax
-   of its configuration file, see
-   <a class="ulink" href="http://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/docs/mdev.txt" target="_top">http://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/docs/mdev.txt</a>.
-</li><li class="listitem">
-The fourth solution is <span class="strong"><strong>Dynamic using devtmpfs + eudev</strong></span>. This
-   method also relies on the <span class="emphasis"><em>devtmpfs</em></span> virtual filesystem detailed
-   above, but adds the <code class="literal">eudev</code> userspace daemon on top of it. <code class="literal">eudev</code>

-The first solution is <span class="strong"><strong>BusyBox</strong></span>. Amongst many programs, BusyBox has
-   an implementation of a basic <code class="literal">init</code> program, which is sufficient
-   for most embedded systems. Enabling the <code class="literal">BR2_INIT_BUSYBOX</code> will
-   ensure BusyBox will build and install its <code class="literal">init</code> program. This is
-   the default solution in Buildroot. The BusyBox <code class="literal">init</code> program will
-   read the <code class="literal">/etc/inittab</code> file at boot to know what to do. The syntax
-   of this file can be found in
-   <a class="ulink" href="http://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/examples/inittab" target="_top">http://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/examples/inittab</a> (note that
-   BusyBox <code class="literal">inittab</code> syntax is special: do not use a random <code class="literal">inittab</code>
-   documentation from the Internet to learn about BusyBox
-   <code class="literal">inittab</code>). The default <code class="literal">inittab</code> in Buildroot is stored in
-   <code class="literal">system/skeleton/etc/inittab</code>. Apart from mounting a few important
-   filesystems, the main job the default inittab does is to start the
-   <code class="literal">/etc/init.d/rcS</code> shell script, and start a <code class="literal">getty</code> program (which
-   provides a login prompt).
-</li><li class="listitem">
-The second solution is <span class="strong"><strong>systemV</strong></span>. This solution uses the old
-   traditional <span class="emphasis"><em>sysvinit</em></span> program, packed in Buildroot in
-   <code class="literal">package/sysvinit</code>. This was the solution used in most desktop
-   Linux distributions, until they switched to more recent
-   alternatives such as Upstart or Systemd. <code class="literal">sysvinit</code> also works with
-   an <code class="literal">inittab</code> file (which has a slightly different syntax than the
-   one from BusyBox). The default <code class="literal">inittab</code> installed with this init
-   solution is located in <code class="literal">package/sysvinit/inittab</code>.
-</li><li class="listitem">
-The third solution is <span class="strong"><strong>systemd</strong></span>. <code class="literal">systemd</code> is the new generation
-   init system for Linux. It does far more than traditional <span class="emphasis"><em>init</em></span>
-   programs: aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket and
-   D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting
-   of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux control groups,
-   supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state,
-   etc. <code class="literal">systemd</code> will be useful on relatively complex embedded
-   systems, for example the ones requiring D-Bus and services
-   communicating between each other. It is worth noting that <code class="literal">systemd</code>

-be rebuilt when the system configuration is changed through <code class="literal">make
-menuconfig</code>, <code class="literal">make xconfig</code> or one of the other configuration
-tools. In some cases, Buildroot should rebuild the entire system, in
-some cases, only a specific subset of packages. But detecting this in
-a completely reliable manner is very difficult, and therefore the
-Buildroot developers have decided to simply not attempt to do this.</p><p>Instead, it is the responsibility of the user to know when a full
-rebuild is necessary. As a hint, here are a few rules of thumb that
-can help you understand how to work with Buildroot:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
-When the target architecture configuration is changed, a complete
-   rebuild is needed. Changing the architecture variant, the binary
-   format or the floating point strategy for example has an impact on
-   the entire system.
-</li><li class="listitem">
-When the toolchain configuration is changed, a complete rebuild
-   generally is needed. Changing the toolchain configuration often
-   involves changing the compiler version, the type of C library or
-   its configuration, or some other fundamental configuration item,
-   and these changes have an impact on the entire system.
-</li><li class="listitem">
-When an additional package is added to the configuration, a full
-   rebuild is not necessarily needed. Buildroot will detect that this
-   package has never been built, and will build it. However, if this
-   package is a library that can optionally be used by packages that
-   have already been built, Buildroot will not automatically rebuild
-   those. Either you know which packages should be rebuilt, and you
-   can rebuild them manually, or you should do a full rebuild. For
-   example, lets suppose you have built a system with the <code class="literal">ctorrent</code>
-   package, but without <code class="literal">openssl</code>. Your system works, but you realize
-   you would like to have SSL support in <code class="literal">ctorrent</code>, so you enable the
-   <code class="literal">openssl</code> package in Buildroot configuration and restart the
-   build. Buildroot will detect that <code class="literal">openssl</code> should be built and
-   will be build it, but it will not detect that <code class="literal">ctorrent</code> should be
-   rebuilt to benefit from <code class="literal">openssl</code> to add OpenSSL support. You will
-   either have to do a full rebuild, or rebuild <code class="literal">ctorrent</code> itself.
-</li><li class="listitem">
-When a package is removed from the configuration, Buildroot does
-   not do anything special. It does not remove the files installed by
-   this package from the target root filesystem or from the toolchain
-   <span class="emphasis"><em>sysroot</em></span>. A full rebuild is needed to get rid of this
-   package. However, generally you dont necessarily need this package
-   to be removed right now: you can wait for the next lunch break to
-   restart the build from scratch.
-</li><li class="listitem">
-When the sub-options of a package are changed, the package is not
-   automatically rebuilt. After making such changes, rebuilding only
-   this package is often sufficient, unless enabling the package
-   sub-option adds some features to the package that are useful for
-   another package which has already been built. Again, Buildroot does
-   not track when a package should be rebuilt: once a package has been
-   built, it is never rebuilt unless explicitly told to do so.
-</li><li class="listitem">
-When a change to the root filesystem skeleton is made, a full
-   rebuild is needed. However, when changes to the root filesystem
-   overlay, a post-build script or a post-image script are made,
-   there is no need for a full rebuild: a simple <code class="literal">make</code> invocation
-   will take the changes into account.
-</li><li class="listitem">
-When a package listed in <code class="literal">FOO_DEPENDENCIES</code> is rebuilt or removed,
-   the package <code class="literal">foo</code> is not automatically rebuilt. For example, if a
-   package <code class="literal">bar</code> is listed in <code class="literal">FOO_DEPENDENCIES</code> with <code class="literal">FOO_DEPENDENCIES
-   = bar</code> and the configuration of the <code class="literal">bar</code> package is changed, the
-   configuration change would not result in a rebuild of package <code class="literal">foo</code>
-   automatically. In this scenario, you may need to either rebuild any
-   packages in your build which reference <code class="literal">bar</code> in their <code class="literal">DEPENDENCIES</code>,
-   or perform a full rebuild to ensure any <code class="literal">bar</code> dependent packages are
-   up to date.
-</li></ul></div><p>Generally speaking, when youre facing a build error and youre unsure
-of the potential consequences of the configuration changes youve
-made, do a full rebuild. If you get the same build error, then you are
-sure that the error is not related to partial rebuilds of packages,
-and if this error occurs with packages from the official Buildroot, do
-not hesitate to report the problem! As your experience with Buildroot
-progresses, you will progressively learn when a full rebuild is really
-necessary, and you will save more and more time.</p><p>For reference, a full rebuild is achieved by running:</p><pre class="screen">$ make clean all</pre></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="rebuild-pkg"></a>8.3.Understanding how to rebuild packages</h2></div></div></div><p>One of the most common questions asked by Buildroot users is how to
-rebuild a given package or how to remove a package without rebuilding
-everything from scratch.</p><p>Removing a package is unsupported by Buildroot without
-rebuilding from scratch. This is because Buildroot doesnt keep track
-of which package installs what files in the <code class="literal">output/staging</code> and
-<code class="literal">output/target</code> directories, or which package would be compiled differently
-depending on the availability of another package.</p><p>The easiest way to rebuild a single package from scratch is to remove
-its build directory in <code class="literal">output/build</code>. Buildroot will then re-extract,
-re-configure, re-compile and re-install this package from scratch. You
-can ask buildroot to do this with the <code class="literal">make &lt;package&gt;-dirclean</code> command.</p><p>On the other hand, if you only want to restart the build process of a
-package from its compilation step, you can run <code class="literal">make &lt;package&gt;-rebuild</code>. It
-will restart the compilation and installation of the package, but not from
-scratch: it basically re-executes <code class="literal">make</code> and <code class="literal">make install</code> inside the package,
-so it will only rebuild files that changed.</p><p>If you want to restart the build process of a package from its configuration
-step, you can run <code class="literal">make &lt;package&gt;-reconfigure</code>. It will restart the
-configuration, compilation and installation of the package.</p><p>While <code class="literal">&lt;package&gt;-rebuild</code> implies <code class="literal">&lt;package&gt;-reinstall</code> and
-<code class="literal">&lt;package&gt;-reconfigure</code> implies <code class="literal">&lt;package&gt;-rebuild</code>, these targets as well
-as <code class="literal">&lt;package&gt;</code> only act on the said package, and do not trigger re-creating
-the root filesystem image. If re-creating the root filesystem in necessary,
-one should in addition run <code class="literal">make</code> or <code class="literal">make all</code>.</p><p>Internally, Buildroot creates so-called <span class="emphasis"><em>stamp files</em></span> to keep track of
-which build steps have been completed for each package. They are
-stored in the package build directory,
-<code class="literal">output/build/&lt;package&gt;-&lt;version&gt;/</code> and are named
-<code class="literal">.stamp_&lt;step-name&gt;</code>. The commands detailed above simply manipulate
-these stamp files to force Buildroot to restart a specific set of
-steps of a package build process.</p><p>Further details about package special make targets are explained in

-it, configure, compile and install the software component found inside
-this tarball. The source code is extracted in
-<code class="literal">output/build/&lt;package&gt;-&lt;version&gt;</code>, which is a temporary directory:
-whenever <code class="literal">make clean</code> is used, this directory is entirely removed, and
-re-created at the next <code class="literal">make</code> invocation. Even when a Git or
-Subversion repository is used as the input for the package source
-code, Buildroot creates a tarball out of it, and then behaves as it
-normally does with tarballs.</p><p>This behavior is well-suited when Buildroot is used mainly as an
-integration tool, to build and integrate all the components of an
-embedded Linux system. However, if one uses Buildroot during the
-development of certain components of the system, this behavior is not
-very convenient: one would instead like to make a small change to the
-source code of one package, and be able to quickly rebuild the system
-with Buildroot.</p><p>Making changes directly in <code class="literal">output/build/&lt;package&gt;-&lt;version&gt;</code> is not
-an appropriate solution, because this directory is removed on <code class="literal">make
-clean</code>.</p><p>Therefore, Buildroot provides a specific mechanism for this use case:
-the <code class="literal">&lt;pkg&gt;_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR</code> mechanism. Buildroot reads an <span class="emphasis"><em>override</em></span>
-file, which allows the user to tell Buildroot the location of the
-source for certain packages.</p><p>The default location of the override file is <code class="literal">$(CONFIG_DIR)/local.mk</code>,
-as defined by the <code class="literal">BR2_PACKAGE_OVERRIDE_FILE</code> configuration option.
-<code class="literal">$(CONFIG_DIR)</code> is the location of the Buildroot <code class="literal">.config</code> file, so
-<code class="literal">local.mk</code> by default lives side-by-side with the <code class="literal">.config</code> file,
-which means:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
-In the top-level Buildroot source directory for in-tree builds
-  (i.e., when <code class="literal">O=</code> is not used)
-</li><li class="listitem">
-In the out-of-tree directory for out-of-tree builds (i.e., when
-  <code class="literal">O=</code> is used)
-</li></ul></div><p>If a different location than these defaults is required, it can be
-specified through the <code class="literal">BR2_PACKAGE_OVERRIDE_FILE</code> configuration
-option.</p><p>In this <span class="emphasis"><em>override</em></span> file, Buildroot expects to find lines of the form:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;pkg1&gt;_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR = /path/to/pkg1/sources
-&lt;pkg2&gt;_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR = /path/to/pkg2/sources</pre><p>For example:</p><pre class="screen">LINUX_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR = /home/bob/linux/
-BUSYBOX_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR = /home/bob/busybox/</pre><p>When Buildroot finds that for a given package, an
-<code class="literal">&lt;pkg&gt;_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR</code> has been defined, it will no longer attempt to
-download, extract and patch the package. Instead, it will directly use
-the source code available in the specified directory and <code class="literal">make clean</code>
-will not touch this directory. This allows to point Buildroot to your
-own directories, that can be managed by Git, Subversion, or any other
-version control system. To achieve this, Buildroot will use <span class="emphasis"><em>rsync</em></span> to
-copy the source code of the component from the specified
-<code class="literal">&lt;pkg&gt;_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR</code> to <code class="literal">output/build/&lt;package&gt;-custom/</code>.</p><p>This mechanism is best used in conjunction with the <code class="literal">make
-&lt;pkg&gt;-rebuild</code> and <code class="literal">make &lt;pkg&gt;-reconfigure</code> targets. A <code class="literal">make
-&lt;pkg&gt;-rebuild all</code> sequence will <span class="emphasis"><em>rsync</em></span> the source code from
-<code class="literal">&lt;pkg&gt;_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR</code> to <code class="literal">output/build/&lt;package&gt;-custom</code> (thanks to
-<span class="emphasis"><em>rsync</em></span>, only the modified files are copied), and restart the build
-process of just this package.</p><p>In the example of the <code class="literal">linux</code> package above, the developer can then
-make a source code change in <code class="literal">/home/bob/linux</code> and then run:</p><pre class="screen">make linux-rebuild all</pre><p>and in a matter of seconds gets the updated Linux kernel image in
-<code class="literal">output/images</code>. Similarly, a change can be made to the BusyBox source
-code in <code class="literal">/home/bob/busybox</code>, and after:</p><pre class="screen">make busybox-rebuild all</pre><p>the root filesystem image in <code class="literal">output/images</code> contains the updated
-BusyBox.</p><p>Source trees for big projects often contain hundreds or thousands of
-files which are not needed for building, but will slow down the process
-of copying the sources with <span class="emphasis"><em>rsync</em></span>. Optionally, it is possible define
-<code class="literal">&lt;pkg&gt;_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR_RSYNC_EXCLUSIONS</code> to skip syncing certain files
-from the source tree. For example, when working on the <code class="literal">webkitgtk</code>
-package, the following will exclude the tests and in-tree builds from
-a local WebKit source tree:</p><pre class="screen">WEBKITGTK_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR = /home/bob/WebKit
-WEBKITGTK_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR_RSYNC_EXCLUSIONS = \
-        --exclude JSTests --exclude ManualTests --exclude PerformanceTests \
-        --exclude WebDriverTests --exclude WebKitBuild --exclude WebKitLibraries \
-        --exclude WebKit.xcworkspace --exclude Websites --exclude Examples</pre><p>By default, Buildroot skips syncing of VCS artifacts (e.g., the <span class="strong"><strong>.git</strong></span> and
-<span class="strong"><strong>.svn</strong></span> directories). Some packages prefer to have these VCS directories
-available during build, for example for automatically determining a precise
-commit reference for version information. To undo this built-in filtering at a
-cost of a slower speed, add these directories back:</p><pre class="screen">LINUX_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR_RSYNC_EXCLUSIONS = --include .git</pre></div></div></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="customize"></a>Chapter9.Project-specific customization</h2></div></div></div><p>Typical actions you may need to perform for a given project are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

-content that may be present in a br2-external tree, like the <code class="literal">configs/</code>
-or <code class="literal">provides/</code> directories. They are described in the following chapters
-as well.</p><p>A complete example br2-external tree layout is also described later.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_the_literal_external_desc_literal_file"></a>The <code class="literal">external.desc</code> file</h4></div></div></div><p>That file describes the br2-external tree: the <span class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>description</em></span>
-for that br2-external tree.</p><p>The format for this file is line based, with each line starting by a
-keyword, followed by a colon and one or more spaces, followed by the
-value assigned to that keyword. There are two keywords currently
-recognised:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
-<code class="literal">name</code>, mandatory, defines the name for that br2-external tree. That
-   name must only use ASCII characters in the set <code class="literal">[A-Za-z0-9_]</code>; any
-   other character is forbidden. Buildroot sets the variable
-   <code class="literal">BR2_EXTERNAL_$(NAME)_PATH</code> to the absolute path of the br2-external
-   tree, so that you can use it to refer to your br2-external tree. This
-   variable is available both in Kconfig, so you can use it to source your
-   Kconfig files (see below) and in the Makefile, so that you can use it
-   to include other Makefiles (see below) or refer to other files (like
-   data files) from your br2-external tree.
-</p><p><strong>Note:</strong>Since it is possible to use multiple br2-external trees at once, this
-  name is used by Buildroot to generate variables for each of those trees.
-  That name is used to identify your br2-external tree, so try to come up
-  with a name that really describes your br2-external tree, in order for
-  it to be relatively unique, so that it does not clash with another name
-  from another br2-external tree, especially if you are planning on
-  somehow sharing your br2-external tree with third parties or using
-  br2-external trees from third parties.</p></li><li class="listitem">
-<code class="literal">desc</code>, optional, provides a short description for that br2-external
-   tree. It shall fit on a single line, is mostly free-form (see below),
-   and is used when displaying information about a br2-external tree (e.g.
-   above the list of defconfig files, or as the prompt in the menuconfig);
-   as such, it should relatively brief (40 chars is probably a good upper
-   limit). The description is available in the <code class="literal">BR2_EXTERNAL_$(NAME)_DESC</code>
-   variable.
-</li></ul></div><p>Examples of names and the corresponding <code class="literal">BR2_EXTERNAL_$(NAME)_PATH</code>

-recipes (i.e. <code class="literal">foo/Config.in</code> and <code class="literal">foo/foo.mk</code> like for packages bundled

-tree to make it appear in the top-level configuration menu, and includes
-the <code class="literal">external.mk</code> from each br2-external tree with the rest of the
-makefile logic.</p><p>The main usage of this is to store package recipes. The recommended way
-to do this is to write a <code class="literal">Config.in</code> file that looks like:</p><pre class="screen">source "$BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH/package/package1/Config.in"
-source "$BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH/package/package2/Config.in"</pre><p>Then, have an <code class="literal">external.mk</code> file that looks like:</p><pre class="screen">include $(sort $(wildcard $(BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH)/package/*/*.mk))</pre><p>And then in <code class="literal">$(BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH)/package/package1</code> and

-Buildroot package recipes, as explained in <a class="xref" href="#adding-packages" title="Chapter18.Adding new packages to Buildroot">Chapter18, <em>Adding new packages to Buildroot</em></a>.
-If you prefer, you can also group the packages in subdirectories
-called &lt;boardname&gt; and adapt the above paths accordingly.</p><p>You can also define custom configuration options in <code class="literal">Config.in</code> and

-output of <code class="literal">make list-defconfigs</code> and allow them to be loaded with the
-normal <code class="literal">make &lt;name&gt;_defconfig</code> command. They will be visible in the
-<span class="emphasis"><em>make list-defconfigs</em></span> output, below an <code class="literal">External configs</code> label that
-contains the name of the br2-external tree they are defined in.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong>If a defconfig file is present in more than one br2-external tree, then

-to override a defconfig bundled in Buildroot or another br2-external
-tree.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_the_literal_provides_literal_directory"></a>The <code class="literal">provides/</code> directory</h4></div></div></div><p>For some packages, Buildroot provides a choice between two (or more)
-implementations of API-compatible such packages. For example, there is
-a choice to choose either libjpeg ot jpeg-turbo; there is one between
-openssl or libressl; there is one to select one of the known,
-pre-configured toolchains</p><p>It is possible for a br2-external to extend those choices, by providing
-a set of files that define those alternatives:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
-<code class="literal">provides/toolchains.in</code> defines the pre-configured toolchains, which
-  will then be listed in the toolchain selection;
-</li><li class="listitem">
-<code class="literal">provides/jpeg.in</code> defines the alternative libjpeg implementations;
-</li><li class="listitem">
-<code class="literal">provides/openssl.in</code> defines the alternative openssl implementations;
-</li><li class="listitem">
-<code class="literal">provides/skeleton.in</code> defines the alternative skeleton implementations;
-</li><li class="listitem">
-<code class="literal">provides/init.in</code> defines the alternative init system implementations, this

-</li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_free_form_content"></a>Free-form content</h4></div></div></div><p>One can store all the board-specific configuration files there, such
-as the kernel configuration, the root filesystem overlay, or any other
-configuration file for which Buildroot allows to set the location (by
-using the <code class="literal">BR2_EXTERNAL_$(NAME)_PATH</code> variable). For example, you
-could set the paths to a global patch directory, to a rootfs overlay
-and to the kernel configuration file as follows (e.g. by running
-<code class="literal">make menuconfig</code> and filling in these options):</p><pre class="screen">BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR=$(BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH)/patches/

-would be to add some tracking of which Buildroot package installs
-what files, with the goals of:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
-being able to remove files installed by a package when this package
-   gets unselected from the menuconfig;
-</li><li class="listitem">
-being able to generate binary packages (ipk or other format) that
-   can be installed on the target without re-generating a new root
-   filesystem image.
-</li></ul></div><p>In general, most people think it is easy to do: just track which package
-installed what and remove it when the package is unselected. However, it
-is much more complicated than that:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
-It is not only about the <code class="literal">target/</code> directory, but also the sysroot in
-   <code class="literal">host/&lt;tuple&gt;/sysroot</code> and the <code class="literal">host/</code> directory itself. All files
-   installed in those directories by various packages must be tracked.
-</li><li class="listitem">
-When a package is unselected from the configuration, it is not
-   sufficient to remove just the files it installed. One must also
-   remove all its reverse dependencies (i.e. packages relying on it)
-   and rebuild all those packages. For example, package A depends
-   optionally on the OpenSSL library. Both are selected, and Buildroot
-   is built. Package A is built with crypto support using OpenSSL.
-   Later on, OpenSSL gets unselected from the configuration, but
-   package A remains (since OpenSSL is an optional dependency, this
-   is possible.) If only OpenSSL files are removed, then the files
-   installed by package A are broken: they use a library that is no
-   longer present on the target. Although this is technically doable,
-   it adds a lot of complexity to Buildroot, which goes against the
-   simplicity we try to stick to.
-</li><li class="listitem">
-In addition to the previous problem, there is the case where the
-   optional dependency is not even known to Buildroot. For example,
-   package A in version 1.0 never used OpenSSL, but in version 2.0 it
-   automatically uses OpenSSL if available. If the Buildroot .mk file
-   hasnt been updated to take this into account, then package A will
-   not be part of the reverse dependencies of OpenSSL and will not be
-   removed and rebuilt when OpenSSL is removed. For sure, the .mk file
-   of package A should be fixed to mention this optional dependency,
-   but in the mean time, you can have non-reproducible behaviors.
-</li><li class="listitem">
-The request is to also allow changes in the menuconfig to be
-   applied on the output directory without having to rebuild
-   everything from scratch. However, this is very difficult to achieve
-   in a reliable way: what happens when the suboptions of a package
-   are changed (we would have to detect this, and rebuild the package
-   from scratch and potentially all its reverse dependencies), what
-   happens if toolchain options are changed, etc. At the moment, what
-   Buildroot does is clear and simple so its behaviour is very
-   reliable and it is easy to support users. If configuration changes
-   done in menuconfig are applied after the next make, then it has to
-   work correctly and properly in all situations, and not have some
-   bizarre corner cases. The risk is to get bug reports like "I have
-   enabled package A, B and C, then ran make, then disabled package
-   C and enabled package D and ran make, then re-enabled package C
-   and enabled package E and then there is a build failure". Or worse
-   "I did some configuration, then built, then did some changes,
-   built, some more changes, built, some more changes, built, and now
-   it fails, but I dont remember all the changes I did and in which
-   order". This will be impossible to support.
-</li></ul></div><p>For all these reasons, the conclusion is that adding tracking of
-installed files to remove them when the package is unselected, or to
-generate a repository of binary packages, is something that is very
-hard to achieve reliably and will add a lot of complexity.</p><p>On this matter, the Buildroot developers make this position statement:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

-hardware boards, so that users of such a board can easily build a system
-that is known to work. You are welcome to add support for other boards
-to Buildroot too.</p><p>To do so, you need to create a normal Buildroot configuration that
-builds a basic system for the hardware: (internal) toolchain, kernel,
-bootloader, filesystem and a simple BusyBox-only userspace. No specific
-package should be selected: the configuration should be as minimal as
-possible, and should only build a working basic BusyBox system for the
-target platform. You can of course use more complicated configurations
-for your internal projects, but the Buildroot project will only
-integrate basic board configurations. This is because package
-selections are highly application-specific.</p><p>Once you have a known working configuration, run <code class="literal">make
-savedefconfig</code>. This will generate a minimal <code class="literal">defconfig</code> file at the
-root of the Buildroot source tree. Move this file into the <code class="literal">configs/</code>
-directory, and rename it <code class="literal">&lt;boardname&gt;_defconfig</code>. If the configuration
-is a bit more complicated, it is nice to manually reformat it and
-separate it into sections, with a comment before each section. Typical
-sections are <span class="emphasis"><em>Architecture</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Toolchain options</em></span> (typically just linux
-headers version), <span class="emphasis"><em>Firmware</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Bootloader</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Kernel</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Filesystem</em></span>.</p><p>Always use fixed versions or commit hashes for the different
-components, not the "latest" version. For example, set
-<code class="literal">BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_VERSION=y</code> and
-<code class="literal">BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_VERSION_VALUE</code> to the kernel version you tested
-with.</p><p>It is recommended to use as much as possible upstream versions of the
-Linux kernel and bootloaders, and to use as much as possible default
-kernel and bootloader configurations. If they are incorrect for your
-board, or no default exists, we encourage you to send fixes to the
-corresponding upstream projects.</p><p>However, in the mean time, you may want to store kernel or bootloader
-configuration or patches specific to your target platform. To do so,
-create a directory <code class="literal">board/&lt;manufacturer&gt;</code> and a subdirectory
-<code class="literal">board/&lt;manufacturer&gt;/&lt;boardname&gt;</code>. You can then store your patches
-and configurations in these directories, and reference them from the main

-the Internet location at which the tarball can be downloaded from
-(<code class="literal">LIBFOO_SITE</code>), the license (<code class="literal">LIBFOO_LICENSE</code>) and file with the

-the same prefix, <code class="literal">LIBFOO_</code> in this case. This prefix is always the
-uppercased version of the package name (see below to understand where
-the package name is defined).</p><p>On line 12, we specify that this package wants to install something to
-the staging space. This is often needed for libraries, since they must
-install header files and other development files in the staging space.
-This will ensure that the commands listed in the

-of the <span class="emphasis"><em>libfoo-config</em></span> files that were installed during

-These *-config files are executable shell script files that are
-located in <span class="emphasis"><em>$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/bin</em></span> directory and are executed
-by other 3rd party packages to find out the location and the linking
-flags of this particular package.</p><p>The problem is that all these *-config files by default give wrong,
-host system linking flags that are unsuitable for cross-compiling.</p><p>For example:    <span class="emphasis"><em>-I/usr/include</em></span> instead of <span class="emphasis"><em>-I$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/include</em></span>
-or:             <span class="emphasis"><em>-L/usr/lib</em></span> instead of <span class="emphasis"><em>-L$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/lib</em></span></p><p>So some sed magic is done to these scripts to make them give correct

-instead</em></span>.</p></div><p>If you made some changes to Buildroot and you would like to contribute
-them to the Buildroot project, proceed as follows.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_the_formatting_of_a_patch"></a>22.5.1.The formatting of a patch</h3></div></div></div><p>We expect patches to be formatted in a specific way. This is necessary
-to make it easy to review patches, to be able to apply them easily to
-the git repository, to make it easy to find back in the history how
-and why things have changed, and to make it possible to use <code class="literal">git
-bisect</code> to locate the origin of a problem.</p><p>First of all, it is essential that the patch has a good commit
-message. The commit message should start with a separate line with a
-brief summary of the change, prefixed by the area touched by the
-patch. A few examples of good commit titles:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
-<code class="literal">package/linuxptp: bump version to 2.0</code>
-</li><li class="listitem">
-<code class="literal">configs/imx23evk: bump Linux version to 4.19</code>
-</li><li class="listitem">
-<code class="literal">package/pkg-generic: postpone evaluation of dependency conditions</code>
-</li><li class="listitem">
-<code class="literal">boot/uboot: needs host-{flex,bison}</code>
-</li><li class="listitem">
-<code class="literal">support/testing: add python-ubjson tests</code>
-</li></ul></div><p>The description that follows the prefix should start with a lower case
-letter (i.e "bump", "needs", "postpone", "add" in the above examples).</p><p>Second, the body of the commit message should describe <span class="emphasis"><em>why</em></span> this
-change is needed, and if necessary also give details about <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> it
-was done. When writing the commit message, think of how the reviewers
-will read it, but also think about how you will read it when you look
-at this change again a few years down the line.</p><p>Third, the patch itself should do only one change, but do it
-completely. Two unrelated or weakly related changes should usually be
-done in two separate patches. This usually means that a patch affects
-only a single package. If several changes are related, it is often
-still possible to split them up in small patches and apply them in a
-specific order. Small patches make it easier to review, and often
-make it easier to understand afterwards why a change was done.
-However, each patch must be complete. It is not allowed that the
-build is broken when only the first but not the second patch is
-applied. This is necessary to be able to use <code class="literal">git bisect</code> afterwards.</p><p>Of course, while youre doing your development, youre probably going
-back and forth between packages, and certainly not committing things
-immediately in a way that is clean enough for submission. So most
-developers rewrite the history of commits to produce a clean set of
-commits that is appropriate for submission. To do this, you need to
-use <span class="emphasis"><em>interactive rebasing</em></span>. You can learn about it
-<a class="ulink" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History" target="_top">in the Pro
-Git book</a>. Sometimes, it is even easier to discard you history with
-<code class="literal">git reset --soft origin/master</code> and select individual changes with
-<code class="literal">git add -i</code> or <code class="literal">git add -p</code>.</p><p>Finally, the patch should be signed off. This is done by adding
-<code class="literal">Signed-off-by: Your Real Name &lt;<a class="ulink" href="mailto:your@email.address" target="_top">your@email.address</a>&gt;</code> at the end of the
-commit message. <code class="literal">git commit -s</code> does that for you, if configured
-properly. The <code class="literal">Signed-off-by</code> tag means that you publish the patch
-under the Buildroot license (i.e. GPL-2.0+, except for package patches,
-which have the upstream license), and that you are allowed to do so.
-See <a class="ulink" href="http://developercertificate.org/" target="_top">the Developer Certificate of
-Origin</a> for details.</p><p>When adding new packages, you should submit every package in a
-separate patch. This patch should have the update to
-<code class="literal">package/Config.in</code>, the package <code class="literal">Config.in</code> file, the <code class="literal">.mk</code> file, the
-<code class="literal">.hash</code> file, any init script, and all package patches. If the package
-has many sub-options, these are sometimes better added as separate
-follow-up patches. The summary line should be something like
-<code class="literal">&lt;packagename&gt;: new package</code>. The body of the commit message can be
-empty for simple packages, or it can contain the description of the
-package (like the Config.in help text). If anything special has to be
-done to build the package, this should also be explained explicitly in
-the commit message body.</p><p>When you bump a package to a new version, you should also submit a
-separate patch for each package. Dont forget to update the <code class="literal">.hash</code>
-file, or add it if it doesnt exist yet. Also dont forget to check if
-the <code class="literal">_LICENSE</code> and <code class="literal">_LICENSE_FILES</code> are still valid. The summary line
-should be something like <code class="literal">&lt;packagename&gt;: bump to version &lt;new
-version&gt;</code>. If the new version only contains security updates compared
-to the existing one, the summary should be <code class="literal">&lt;packagename&gt;: security
-bump to version &lt;new version&gt;</code> and the commit message body should show
-the CVE numbers that are fixed. If some package patches can be removed
-in the new version, it should be explained explicitly why they can be
-removed, preferably with the upstream commit ID. Also any other
-required changes should be explained explicitly, like configure
-options that no longer exist or are no longer needed.</p><p>If you are interested in getting notified of build failures and of
-further changes in the packages you added or modified, please add
-yourself to the DEVELOPERS file. This should be done in the same patch
-creating or modifying the package. See <a class="link" href="#DEVELOPERS" title="Chapter23.DEVELOPERS file and get-developers">the DEVELOPERS file</a>

-Chapter1.About Buildroot
-
-Buildroot is a tool that simplifies and automates the process of
-building a complete Linux system for an embedded system, using
-cross-compilation.
-
-In order to achieve this, Buildroot is able to generate a
-cross-compilation toolchain, a root filesystem, a Linux kernel image
-and a bootloader for your target. Buildroot can be used for any
-combination of these options, independently (you can for example use
-an existing cross-compilation toolchain, and build only your root
-filesystem with Buildroot).
-
-Buildroot is useful mainly for people working with embedded systems.
-Embedded systems often use processors that are not the regular x86
-processors everyone is used to having in his PC. They can be PowerPC
-processors, MIPS processors, ARM processors, etc.
-
-Buildroot supports numerous processors and their variants; it also
-comes with default configurations for several boards available
-off-the-shelf. Besides this, a number of third-party projects are
-based on, or develop their BSP ^[1] or SDK ^[2] on top of Buildroot.

-
-Chapter2.System requirements
-
-Buildroot is designed to run on Linux systems.
-
-While Buildroot itself will build most host packages it needs for the
-compilation, certain standard Linux utilities are expected to be
-already installed on the host system. Below you will find an overview
-of the mandatory and optional packages (note that package names may
-vary between distributions).
-
-2.1.Mandatory packages
-
-  * Build tools:
-
-      + which
-      + sed
-      + make (version 3.81 or any later)
-      + binutils
-      + build-essential (only for Debian based systems)
-      + gcc (version 4.8 or any later)
-      + g++ (version 4.8 or any later)
-      + bash
-      + patch
-      + gzip
-      + bzip2
-      + perl (version 5.8.7 or any later)
-      + tar
-      + cpio
-      + unzip
-      + rsync
-      + file (must be in /usr/bin/file)
-      + bc
-  * Source fetching tools:
-
-      + wget
-
-2.2.Optional packages
-
-  * Recommended dependencies:
-
-    Some features or utilities in Buildroot, like the legal-info, or
-    the graph generation tools, have additional dependencies.
-    Although they are not mandatory for a simple build, they are
-    still highly recommended:
-
-      + python (version 2.7 or any later)
-  * Configuration interface dependencies:
-
-    For these libraries, you need to install both runtime and
-    development data, which in many distributions are packaged
-    separately. The development packages typically have a -dev or 
-    -devel suffix.
-
-      + ncurses5 to use the menuconfig interface
-      + qt5 to use the xconfig interface
-      + glib2, gtk2 and glade2 to use the gconfig interface
-  * Source fetching tools:
-
-    In the official tree, most of the package sources are retrieved
-    using wget from ftp, http or https locations. A few packages are
-    only available through a version control system. Moreover,
-    Buildroot is capable of downloading sources via other tools, like
-    rsync or scp (refer to Chapter20, Download infrastructure for
-    more details). If you enable packages using any of these methods,
-    you will need to install the corresponding tool on the host
-    system:
-
-      + bazaar
-      + cvs
-      + git
-      + mercurial
-      + rsync
-      + scp
-      + subversion
-  * Java-related packages, if the Java Classpath needs to be built
-    for the target system:
-
-      + The javac compiler
-      + The jar tool
-  * Documentation generation tools:
-
-      + asciidoc, version 8.6.3 or higher
-      + w3m
-      + python with the argparse module (automatically present in
-        2.7+ and 3.2+)
-      + dblatex (required for the pdf manual only)
-  * Graph generation tools:
-
-      + graphviz to use graph-depends and <pkg>-graph-depends
-      + python-matplotlib to use graph-build
-
-Chapter3.Getting Buildroot
-
-Buildroot releases are made every 3 months, in February, May, August
-and November. Release numbers are in the format YYYY.MM, so for
-example 2013.02, 2014.08.
-
-Release tarballs are available at http://buildroot.org/downloads/.
-
-For your convenience, a Vagrantfile [https://www.vagrantup.com/] is
-available in support/misc/Vagrantfile in the Buildroot source tree to
-quickly set up a virtual machine with the needed dependencies to get
-started.
-
-If you want to setup an isolated buildroot environment on Linux or
-Mac Os X, paste this line onto your terminal:
-
-curl -O https://buildroot.org/downloads/Vagrantfile; vagrant up
-
-If you are on Windows, paste this into your powershell:
-
-(new-object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(
-"https://buildroot.org/downloads/Vagrantfile","Vagrantfile");
-vagrant up
-
-If you want to follow development, you can use the daily snapshots or
-make a clone of the Git repository. Refer to the Download page [http:
-//buildroot.org/download] of the Buildroot website for more details.
-
-Chapter4.Buildroot quick start
-
-Important: you can and should build everything as a normal user.
-There is no need to be root to configure and use Buildroot. By
-running all commands as a regular user, you protect your system
-against packages behaving badly during compilation and installation.
-
-The first step when using Buildroot is to create a configuration.
-Buildroot has a nice configuration tool similar to the one you can
-find in the Linux kernel [http://www.kernel.org/] or in BusyBox
-[http://www.busybox.net/].
-
-From the buildroot directory, run
-
- $ make menuconfig
-
-for the original curses-based configurator, or
-
- $ make nconfig
-
-for the new curses-based configurator, or
-
- $ make xconfig
-
-for the Qt-based configurator, or
-
- $ make gconfig
-
-for the GTK-based configurator.
-
-All of these "make" commands will need to build a configuration
-utility (including the interface), so you may need to install
-"development" packages for relevant libraries used by the
-configuration utilities. Refer to Chapter2, System requirements for
-more details, specifically the optional requirements to get the
-dependencies of your favorite interface.
-
-For each menu entry in the configuration tool, you can find
-associated help that describes the purpose of the entry. Refer to
-Chapter6, Buildroot configuration for details on some specific
-configuration aspects.
-
-Once everything is configured, the configuration tool generates a
-.config file that contains the entire configuration. This file will
-be read by the top-level Makefile.
-
-To start the build process, simply run:
-
- $ make
-
-By default, Buildroot does not support top-level parallel build, so
-running make -jN is not necessary. There is however experimental
-support for top-level parallel build, see Section8.12, Top-level
-parallel build.
-
-The make command will generally perform the following steps:
-
-  * download source files (as required);
-  * configure, build and install the cross-compilation toolchain, or
-    simply import an external toolchain;
-  * configure, build and install selected target packages;
-  * build a kernel image, if selected;
-  * build a bootloader image, if selected;
-  * create a root filesystem in selected formats.
-
-Buildroot output is stored in a single directory, output/. This
-directory contains several subdirectories:
-
-  * images/ where all the images (kernel image, bootloader and root
-    filesystem images) are stored. These are the files you need to
-    put on your target system.
-  * build/ where all the components are built (this includes tools
-    needed by Buildroot on the host and packages compiled for the
-    target). This directory contains one subdirectory for each of
-    these components.
-  * host/ contains both the tools built for the host, and the sysroot
-    of the target toolchain. The former is an installation of tools
-    compiled for the host that are needed for the proper execution of
-    Buildroot, including the cross-compilation toolchain. The latter
-    is a hierarchy similar to a root filesystem hierarchy. It
-    contains the headers and libraries of all user-space packages
-    that provide and install libraries used by other packages.
-    However, this directory is not intended to be the root filesystem
-    for the target: it contains a lot of development files,
-    unstripped binaries and libraries that make it far too big for an
-    embedded system. These development files are used to compile
-    libraries and applications for the target that depend on other
-    libraries.
-  * staging/ is a symlink to the target toolchain sysroot inside host
-    /, which exists for backwards compatibility.
-  * target/ which contains almost the complete root filesystem for
-    the target: everything needed is present except the device files
-    in /dev/ (Buildroot cant create them because Buildroot doesnt
-    run as root and doesnt want to run as root). Also, it doesnt
-    have the correct permissions (e.g. setuid for the busybox
-    binary). Therefore, this directory should not be used on your
-    target. Instead, you should use one of the images built in the
-    images/ directory. If you need an extracted image of the root
-    filesystem for booting over NFS, then use the tarball image
-    generated in images/ and extract it as root. Compared to staging
-    /, target/ contains only the files and libraries needed to run
-    the selected target applications: the development files (headers,
-    etc.) are not present, the binaries are stripped.
-
-These commands, make menuconfig|nconfig|gconfig|xconfig and make, are
-the basic ones that allow to easily and quickly generate images
-fitting your needs, with all the features and applications you
-enabled.
-
-More details about the "make" command usage are given in Section8.1,
-make tips.
-
-Chapter5.Community resources
-
-Like any open source project, Buildroot has different ways to share
-information in its community and outside.
-
-Each of those ways may interest you if you are looking for some help,
-want to understand Buildroot or contribute to the project.
-
-Mailing List
-
-    Buildroot has a mailing list for discussion and development. It
-    is the main method of interaction for Buildroot users and
-    developers.
-
-    Only subscribers to the Buildroot mailing list are allowed to
-    post to this list. You can subscribe via the mailing list info
-    page [http://lists.buildroot.org/mailman/listinfo/buildroot].
-
-    Mails that are sent to the mailing list are also available in the
-    mailing list archives, available through Mailman [http://
-    lists.buildroot.org/pipermail/buildroot] or at lore.kernel.org
-    [https://lore.kernel.org/buildroot/].
-
-IRC
-
-    The Buildroot IRC channel #buildroot [irc://irc.oftc.net/#
-    buildroot] is hosted on OFTC [https://www.oftc.net/WebChat/]. It
-    is a useful place to ask quick questions or discuss on certain
-    topics.
-
-    When asking for help on IRC, share relevant logs or pieces of
-    code using a code sharing website, such as https://paste.ack.tf/.
-
-    Note that for certain questions, posting to the mailing list may
-    be better as it will reach more people, both developers and
-    users.
-
-Bug tracker
-    Bugs in Buildroot can be reported via the mailing list or
-    alternatively via the Buildroot bugtracker [https://
-    bugs.buildroot.org/buglist.cgi?product=buildroot]. Please refer
-    to Section22.6, Reporting issues/bugs or getting help before
-    creating a bug report.
-Wiki
-    The Buildroot wiki page [http://elinux.org/Buildroot] is hosted
-    on the eLinux [http://elinux.org] wiki. It contains some useful
-    links, an overview of past and upcoming events, and a TODO list.
-Patchwork
-
-    Patchwork is a web-based patch tracking system designed to
-    facilitate the contribution and management of contributions to an
-    open-source project. Patches that have been sent to a mailing
-    list are 'caught' by the system, and appear on a web page. Any
-    comments posted that reference the patch are appended to the
-    patch page too. For more information on Patchwork see http://
-    jk.ozlabs.org/projects/patchwork/.
-
-    Buildroots Patchwork website is mainly for use by Buildroots
-    maintainer to ensure patches arent missed. It is also used by
-    Buildroot patch reviewers (see also Section22.3.1, Applying
-    Patches from Patchwork). However, since the website exposes
-    patches and their corresponding review comments in a clean and
-    concise web interface, it can be useful for all Buildroot
-    developers.
-
-    The Buildroot patch management interface is available at http://
-    patchwork.buildroot.org.

-
-All the configuration options in make *config have a help text
-providing details about the option.
-
-The make *config commands also offer a search tool. Read the help
-message in the different frontend menus to know how to use it:
-
-  * in menuconfig, the search tool is called by pressing /;
-  * in xconfig, the search tool is called by pressing Ctrl + f.
-
-The result of the search shows the help message of the matching
-items. In menuconfig, numbers in the left column provide a shortcut
-to the corresponding entry. Just type this number to directly jump to
-the entry, or to the containing menu in case the entry is not
-selectable due to a missing dependency.
-
-Although the menu structure and the help text of the entries should
-be sufficiently self-explanatory, a number of topics require
-additional explanation that cannot easily be covered in the help text
-and are therefore covered in the following sections.
-
-6.1.Cross-compilation toolchain
-
-A compilation toolchain is the set of tools that allows you to
-compile code for your system. It consists of a compiler (in our case,
-gcc), binary utils like assembler and linker (in our case, binutils)
-and a C standard library (for example GNU Libc [http://www.gnu.org/
-software/libc/libc.html], uClibc-ng [http://www.uclibc-ng.org/]).
-
-The system installed on your development station certainly already
-has a compilation toolchain that you can use to compile an
-application that runs on your system. If youre using a PC, your
-compilation toolchain runs on an x86 processor and generates code for
-an x86 processor. Under most Linux systems, the compilation toolchain
-uses the GNU libc (glibc) as the C standard library. This compilation
-toolchain is called the "host compilation toolchain". The machine on
-which it is running, and on which youre working, is called the "host
-system" ^[3].
-
-The compilation toolchain is provided by your distribution, and
-Buildroot has nothing to do with it (other than using it to build a
-cross-compilation toolchain and other tools that are run on the
-development host).
-
-As said above, the compilation toolchain that comes with your system
-runs on and generates code for the processor in your host system. As
-your embedded system has a different processor, you need a
-cross-compilation toolchain - a compilation toolchain that runs on
-your host system but generates code for your target system (and
-target processor). For example, if your host system uses x86 and your
-target system uses ARM, the regular compilation toolchain on your
-host runs on x86 and generates code for x86, while the
-cross-compilation toolchain runs on x86 and generates code for ARM.
-
-Buildroot provides two solutions for the cross-compilation toolchain:
-
-  * The internal toolchain backend, called Buildroot toolchain in the
-    configuration interface.
-  * The external toolchain backend, called External toolchain in the
-    configuration interface.
-
-The choice between these two solutions is done using the Toolchain
-Type option in the Toolchain menu. Once one solution has been chosen,
-a number of configuration options appear, they are detailed in the
-following sections.
-
-6.1.1.Internal toolchain backend
-
-The internal toolchain backend is the backend where Buildroot builds
-by itself a cross-compilation toolchain, before building the
-userspace applications and libraries for your target embedded system.
-
-This backend supports several C libraries: uClibc-ng [http://
-www.uclibc-ng.org], glibc [http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/
-libc.html] and musl [http://www.musl-libc.org].
-
-Once you have selected this backend, a number of options appear. The
-most important ones allow to:
-
-  * Change the version of the Linux kernel headers used to build the
-    toolchain. This item deserves a few explanations. In the process
-    of building a cross-compilation toolchain, the C library is being
-    built. This library provides the interface between userspace
-    applications and the Linux kernel. In order to know how to "talk"
-    to the Linux kernel, the C library needs to have access to the 
-    Linux kernel headers (i.e. the .h files from the kernel), which
-    define the interface between userspace and the kernel (system
-    calls, data structures, etc.). Since this interface is backward
-    compatible, the version of the Linux kernel headers used to build
-    your toolchain do not need to match exactly the version of the
-    Linux kernel you intend to run on your embedded system. They only
-    need to have a version equal or older to the version of the Linux
-    kernel you intend to run. If you use kernel headers that are more
-    recent than the Linux kernel you run on your embedded system,
-    then the C library might be using interfaces that are not
-    provided by your Linux kernel.
-  * Change the version of the GCC compiler, binutils and the C
-    library.
-  * Select a number of toolchain options (uClibc only): whether the
-    toolchain should have RPC support (used mainly for NFS),
-    wide-char support, locale support (for internationalization), C++
-    support or thread support. Depending on which options you choose,
-    the number of userspace applications and libraries visible in
-    Buildroot menus will change: many applications and libraries
-    require certain toolchain options to be enabled. Most packages
-    show a comment when a certain toolchain option is required to be
-    able to enable those packages. If needed, you can further refine
-    the uClibc configuration by running make uclibc-menuconfig. Note
-    however that all packages in Buildroot are tested against the
-    default uClibc configuration bundled in Buildroot: if you deviate
-    from this configuration by removing features from uClibc, some
-    packages may no longer build.
-
-It is worth noting that whenever one of those options is modified,
-then the entire toolchain and system must be rebuilt. See
-Section8.2, Understanding when a full rebuild is necessary.
-
-Advantages of this backend:
-
-  * Well integrated with Buildroot
-  * Fast, only builds whats necessary
-
-Drawbacks of this backend:
-
-  * Rebuilding the toolchain is needed when doing make clean, which
-    takes time. If youre trying to reduce your build time, consider
-    using the External toolchain backend.
-
-6.1.2.External toolchain backend
-
-The external toolchain backend allows to use existing pre-built
-cross-compilation toolchains. Buildroot knows about a number of
-well-known cross-compilation toolchains (from Linaro [http://
-www.linaro.org] for ARM, Sourcery CodeBench [http://www.mentor.com/
-embedded-software/sourcery-tools/sourcery-codebench/editions/
-lite-edition/] for ARM, x86-64, PowerPC, and MIPS, and is capable of
-downloading them automatically, or it can be pointed to a custom
-toolchain, either available for download or installed locally.
-
-Then, you have three solutions to use an external toolchain:
-
-  * Use a predefined external toolchain profile, and let Buildroot
-    download, extract and install the toolchain. Buildroot already
-    knows about a few CodeSourcery and Linaro toolchains. Just select
-    the toolchain profile in Toolchain from the available ones. This
-    is definitely the easiest solution.
-  * Use a predefined external toolchain profile, but instead of
-    having Buildroot download and extract the toolchain, you can tell
-    Buildroot where your toolchain is already installed on your
-    system. Just select the toolchain profile in Toolchain through
-    the available ones, unselect Download toolchain automatically,
-    and fill the Toolchain path text entry with the path to your
-    cross-compiling toolchain.
-  * Use a completely custom external toolchain. This is particularly
-    useful for toolchains generated using crosstool-NG or with
-    Buildroot itself. To do this, select the Custom toolchain
-    solution in the Toolchain list. You need to fill the Toolchain
-    path, Toolchain prefix and External toolchain C library options.
-    Then, you have to tell Buildroot what your external toolchain
-    supports. If your external toolchain uses the glibc library, you
-    only have to tell whether your toolchain supports C++ or not and
-    whether it has built-in RPC support. If your external toolchain
-    uses the uClibc library, then you have to tell Buildroot if it
-    supports RPC, wide-char, locale, program invocation, threads and
-    C++. At the beginning of the execution, Buildroot will tell you
-    if the selected options do not match the toolchain configuration.
-
-Our external toolchain support has been tested with toolchains from
-CodeSourcery and Linaro, toolchains generated by crosstool-NG [http:/
-/crosstool-ng.org], and toolchains generated by Buildroot itself. In
-general, all toolchains that support the sysroot feature should work.
-If not, do not hesitate to contact the developers.
-
-We do not support toolchains or SDK generated by OpenEmbedded or
-Yocto, because these toolchains are not pure toolchains (i.e. just
-the compiler, binutils, the C and C++ libraries). Instead these
-toolchains come with a very large set of pre-compiled libraries and
-programs. Therefore, Buildroot cannot import the sysroot of the
-toolchain, as it would contain hundreds of megabytes of pre-compiled
-libraries that are normally built by Buildroot.
-
-We also do not support using the distribution toolchain (i.e. the gcc
-/binutils/C library installed by your distribution) as the toolchain
-to build software for the target. This is because your distribution
-toolchain is not a "pure" toolchain (i.e. only with the C/C++
-library), so we cannot import it properly into the Buildroot build
-environment. So even if you are building a system for a x86 or x86_64
-target, you have to generate a cross-compilation toolchain with
-Buildroot or crosstool-NG.
-
-If you want to generate a custom toolchain for your project, that can
-be used as an external toolchain in Buildroot, our recommendation is
-to build it either with Buildroot itself (see Section6.1.3, Build
-an external toolchain with Buildroot) or with crosstool-NG [http://
-crosstool-ng.org].
-
-Advantages of this backend:
-
-  * Allows to use well-known and well-tested cross-compilation
-    toolchains.
-  * Avoids the build time of the cross-compilation toolchain, which
-    is often very significant in the overall build time of an
-    embedded Linux system.
-
-Drawbacks of this backend:
-
-  * If your pre-built external toolchain has a bug, may be hard to
-    get a fix from the toolchain vendor, unless you build your
-    external toolchain by yourself using Buildroot or Crosstool-NG.
-
-6.1.3.Build an external toolchain with Buildroot
-
-The Buildroot internal toolchain option can be used to create an
-external toolchain. Here are a series of steps to build an internal
-toolchain and package it up for reuse by Buildroot itself (or other
-projects).
-
-Create a new Buildroot configuration, with the following details:
-
-  * Select the appropriate Target options for your target CPU
-    architecture
-  * In the Toolchain menu, keep the default of Buildroot toolchain
-    for Toolchain type, and configure your toolchain as desired
-  * In the System configuration menu, select None as the Init system
-    and none as /bin/sh
-  * In the Target packages menu, disable BusyBox
-  * In the Filesystem images menu, disable tar the root filesystem
-
-Then, we can trigger the build, and also ask Buildroot to generate a
-SDK. This will conveniently generate for us a tarball which contains
-our toolchain:
-
-make sdk
-
-This produces the SDK tarball in $(O)/images, with a name similar to
-arm-buildroot-linux-uclibcgnueabi_sdk-buildroot.tar.gz. Save this
-tarball, as it is now the toolchain that you can re-use as an
-external toolchain in other Buildroot projects.
-
-In those other Buildroot projects, in the Toolchain menu:
-
-  * Set Toolchain type to External toolchain
-  * Set Toolchain to Custom toolchain
-  * Set Toolchain origin to Toolchain to be downloaded and installed
-  * Set Toolchain URL to file:///path/to/your/sdk/tarball.tar.gz
-
-6.1.3.1.External toolchain wrapper
-
-When using an external toolchain, Buildroot generates a wrapper
-program, that transparently passes the appropriate options (according
-to the configuration) to the external toolchain programs. In case you
-need to debug this wrapper to check exactly what arguments are
-passed, you can set the environment variable BR2_DEBUG_WRAPPER to
-either one of:
-
-  * 0, empty or not set: no debug
-  * 1: trace all arguments on a single line
-  * 2: trace one argument per line
-
-6.2./dev management
-
-On a Linux system, the /dev directory contains special files, called 
-device files, that allow userspace applications to access the
-hardware devices managed by the Linux kernel. Without these device
-files, your userspace applications would not be able to use the
-hardware devices, even if they are properly recognized by the Linux
-kernel.
-
-Under System configuration, /dev management, Buildroot offers four
-different solutions to handle the /dev directory :
-
-  * The first solution is Static using device table. This is the old
-    classical way of handling device files in Linux. With this
-    method, the device files are persistently stored in the root
-    filesystem (i.e. they persist across reboots), and there is
-    nothing that will automatically create and remove those device
-    files when hardware devices are added or removed from the system.
-    Buildroot therefore creates a standard set of device files using
-    a device table, the default one being stored in system/
-    device_table_dev.txt in the Buildroot source code. This file is
-    processed when Buildroot generates the final root filesystem
-    image, and the device files are therefore not visible in the
-    output/target directory. The BR2_ROOTFS_STATIC_DEVICE_TABLE
-    option allows to change the default device table used by
-    Buildroot, or to add an additional device table, so that
-    additional device files are created by Buildroot during the
-    build. So, if you use this method, and a device file is missing
-    in your system, you can for example create a board/<yourcompany>/
-    <yourproject>/device_table_dev.txt file that contains the
-    description of your additional device files, and then you can set
-    BR2_ROOTFS_STATIC_DEVICE_TABLE to system/device_table_dev.txt
-    board/<yourcompany>/<yourproject>/device_table_dev.txt. For more
-    details about the format of the device table file, see
-    Chapter25, Makedev syntax documentation.
-  * The second solution is Dynamic using devtmpfs only. devtmpfs is a
-    virtual filesystem inside the Linux kernel that has been
-    introduced in kernel 2.6.32 (if you use an older kernel, it is
-    not possible to use this option). When mounted in /dev, this
-    virtual filesystem will automatically make device files appear
-    and disappear as hardware devices are added and removed from the
-    system. This filesystem is not persistent across reboots: it is
-    filled dynamically by the kernel. Using devtmpfs requires the
-    following kernel configuration options to be enabled:
-    CONFIG_DEVTMPFS and CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT. When Buildroot is in
-    charge of building the Linux kernel for your embedded device, it
-    makes sure that those two options are enabled. However, if you
-    build your Linux kernel outside of Buildroot, then it is your
-    responsibility to enable those two options (if you fail to do so,
-    your Buildroot system will not boot).
-  * The third solution is Dynamic using devtmpfs + mdev. This method
-    also relies on the devtmpfs virtual filesystem detailed above (so
-    the requirement to have CONFIG_DEVTMPFS and CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT
-    enabled in the kernel configuration still apply), but adds the
-    mdev userspace utility on top of it. mdev is a program part of
-    BusyBox that the kernel will call every time a device is added or
-    removed. Thanks to the /etc/mdev.conf configuration file, mdev
-    can be configured to for example, set specific permissions or
-    ownership on a device file, call a script or application whenever
-    a device appears or disappear, etc. Basically, it allows 
-    userspace to react on device addition and removal events. mdev
-    can for example be used to automatically load kernel modules when
-    devices appear on the system. mdev is also important if you have
-    devices that require a firmware, as it will be responsible for
-    pushing the firmware contents to the kernel. mdev is a
-    lightweight implementation (with fewer features) of udev. For
-    more details about mdev and the syntax of its configuration file,
-    see http://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/docs/mdev.txt.
-  * The fourth solution is Dynamic using devtmpfs + eudev. This
-    method also relies on the devtmpfs virtual filesystem detailed
-    above, but adds the eudev userspace daemon on top of it. eudev is
-    a daemon that runs in the background, and gets called by the
-    kernel when a device gets added or removed from the system. It is
-    a more heavyweight solution than mdev, but provides higher
-    flexibility. eudev is a standalone version of udev, the original
-    userspace daemon used in most desktop Linux distributions, which
-    is now part of Systemd. For more details, see http://
-    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udev.
-
-The Buildroot developers recommendation is to start with the Dynamic
-using devtmpfs only solution, until you have the need for userspace
-to be notified when devices are added/removed, or if firmwares are
-needed, in which case Dynamic using devtmpfs + mdev is usually a good
-solution.
-
-Note that if systemd is chosen as init system, /dev management will
-be performed by the udev program provided by systemd.
-
-6.3.init system
-
-The init program is the first userspace program started by the kernel
-(it carries the PID number 1), and is responsible for starting the
-userspace services and programs (for example: web server, graphical
-applications, other network servers, etc.).
-
-Buildroot allows to use three different types of init systems, which
-can be chosen from System configuration, Init system:
-
-  * The first solution is BusyBox. Amongst many programs, BusyBox has
-    an implementation of a basic init program, which is sufficient
-    for most embedded systems. Enabling the BR2_INIT_BUSYBOX will
-    ensure BusyBox will build and install its init program. This is
-    the default solution in Buildroot. The BusyBox init program will
-    read the /etc/inittab file at boot to know what to do. The syntax
-    of this file can be found in http://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/
-    examples/inittab (note that BusyBox inittab syntax is special: do
-    not use a random inittab documentation from the Internet to learn
-    about BusyBox inittab). The default inittab in Buildroot is
-    stored in system/skeleton/etc/inittab. Apart from mounting a few
-    important filesystems, the main job the default inittab does is
-    to start the /etc/init.d/rcS shell script, and start a getty
-    program (which provides a login prompt).
-  * The second solution is systemV. This solution uses the old
-    traditional sysvinit program, packed in Buildroot in package/
-    sysvinit. This was the solution used in most desktop Linux
-    distributions, until they switched to more recent alternatives
-    such as Upstart or Systemd. sysvinit also works with an inittab
-    file (which has a slightly different syntax than the one from
-    BusyBox). The default inittab installed with this init solution
-    is located in package/sysvinit/inittab.
-  * The third solution is systemd. systemd is the new generation init
-    system for Linux. It does far more than traditional init
-    programs: aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket
-    and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand
-    starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux control
-    groups, supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state,
-    etc. systemd will be useful on relatively complex embedded
-    systems, for example the ones requiring D-Bus and services
-    communicating between each other. It is worth noting that systemd
-    brings a fairly big number of large dependencies: dbus, udev and
-    more. For more details about systemd, see http://
-    www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd.
-
-The solution recommended by Buildroot developers is to use the 
-BusyBox init as it is sufficient for most embedded systems. systemd
-can be used for more complex situations.
-

-^[3] This terminology differs from what is used by GNU configure,
-where the host is the machine on which the application will run
-(which is usually the same as target)
-
-Chapter7.Configuration of other components
-
-Before attempting to modify any of the components below, make sure
-you have already configured Buildroot itself, and have enabled the
-corresponding package.
-
-BusyBox
-
-    If you already have a BusyBox configuration file, you can
-    directly specify this file in the Buildroot configuration, using
-    BR2_PACKAGE_BUSYBOX_CONFIG. Otherwise, Buildroot will start from
-    a default BusyBox configuration file.
-
-    To make subsequent changes to the configuration, use make
-    busybox-menuconfig to open the BusyBox configuration editor.
-
-    It is also possible to specify a BusyBox configuration file
-    through an environment variable, although this is not
-    recommended. Refer to Section8.6, Environment variables for
-    more details.
-
-uClibc
-    Configuration of uClibc is done in the same way as for BusyBox.
-    The configuration variable to specify an existing configuration
-    file is BR2_UCLIBC_CONFIG. The command to make subsequent changes
-    is make uclibc-menuconfig.
-Linux kernel
-
-    If you already have a kernel configuration file, you can directly
-    specify this file in the Buildroot configuration, using
-    BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_USE_CUSTOM_CONFIG.
-
-    If you do not yet have a kernel configuration file, you can
-    either start by specifying a defconfig in the Buildroot
-    configuration, using BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_USE_DEFCONFIG, or start by
-    creating an empty file and specifying it as custom configuration
-    file, using BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_USE_CUSTOM_CONFIG.
-
-    To make subsequent changes to the configuration, use make
-    linux-menuconfig to open the Linux configuration editor.
-
-Barebox
-    Configuration of Barebox is done in the same way as for the Linux
-    kernel. The corresponding configuration variables are
-    BR2_TARGET_BAREBOX_USE_CUSTOM_CONFIG and
-    BR2_TARGET_BAREBOX_USE_DEFCONFIG. To open the configuration
-    editor, use make barebox-menuconfig.
-U-Boot
-    Configuration of U-Boot (version 2015.04 or newer) is done in the
-    same way as for the Linux kernel. The corresponding configuration
-    variables are BR2_TARGET_UBOOT_USE_CUSTOM_CONFIG and
-    BR2_TARGET_UBOOT_USE_DEFCONFIG. To open the configuration editor,
-    use make uboot-menuconfig.

-
-8.1.make tips
-
-This is a collection of tips that help you make the most of
-Buildroot.
-
-Display all commands executed by make:
-
- $ make V=1 <target>
-
-Display the list of boards with a defconfig:
-
- $ make list-defconfigs
-
-Display all available targets:
-
- $ make help
-
-Not all targets are always available, some settings in the .config
-file may hide some targets:
-
-  * busybox-menuconfig only works when busybox is enabled;
-  * linux-menuconfig and linux-savedefconfig only work when linux is
-    enabled;
-  * uclibc-menuconfig is only available when the uClibc C library is
-    selected in the internal toolchain backend;
-  * barebox-menuconfig and barebox-savedefconfig only work when the
-    barebox bootloader is enabled.
-  * uboot-menuconfig and uboot-savedefconfig only work when the
-    U-Boot bootloader is enabled.
-
-Cleaning:Explicit cleaning is required when any of the architecture
-or toolchain configuration options are changed.
-
-To delete all build products (including build directories, host,
-staging and target trees, the images and the toolchain):
-
- $ make clean
-
-Generating the manual:The present manual sources are located in the 
-docs/manual directory. To generate the manual:
-
- $ make manual-clean
- $ make manual
-
-The manual outputs will be generated in output/docs/manual.
-
-Notes
-
-  * A few tools are required to build the documentation (see:
-    Section2.2, Optional packages).
-
-Resetting Buildroot for a new target:To delete all build products as
-well as the configuration:
-
- $ make distclean
-
-Notes.If ccache is enabled, running make clean or distclean does not
-empty the compiler cache used by Buildroot. To delete it, refer to
-Section8.14.3, Using ccache in Buildroot.
-
-Dumping the internal make variables:One can dump the variables known
-to make, along with their values:
-
- $ make -s printvars VARS='VARIABLE1 VARIABLE2'
- VARIABLE1=value_of_variable
- VARIABLE2=value_of_variable
-
-It is possible to tweak the output using some variables:
-
-  * VARS will limit the listing to variables which names match the
-    specified make-patterns - this must be set else nothing is
-    printed
-  * QUOTED_VARS, if set to YES, will single-quote the value
-  * RAW_VARS, if set to YES, will print the unexpanded value
-
-For example:
-
- $ make -s printvars VARS=BUSYBOX_%DEPENDENCIES
- BUSYBOX_DEPENDENCIES=skeleton toolchain
- BUSYBOX_FINAL_ALL_DEPENDENCIES=skeleton toolchain
- BUSYBOX_FINAL_DEPENDENCIES=skeleton toolchain
- BUSYBOX_FINAL_PATCH_DEPENDENCIES=
- BUSYBOX_RDEPENDENCIES=ncurses util-linux
-
- $ make -s printvars VARS=BUSYBOX_%DEPENDENCIES QUOTED_VARS=YES
- BUSYBOX_DEPENDENCIES='skeleton toolchain'
- BUSYBOX_FINAL_ALL_DEPENDENCIES='skeleton toolchain'
- BUSYBOX_FINAL_DEPENDENCIES='skeleton toolchain'
- BUSYBOX_FINAL_PATCH_DEPENDENCIES=''
- BUSYBOX_RDEPENDENCIES='ncurses util-linux'
-
- $ make -s printvars VARS=BUSYBOX_%DEPENDENCIES RAW_VARS=YES
- BUSYBOX_DEPENDENCIES=skeleton toolchain
- BUSYBOX_FINAL_ALL_DEPENDENCIES=$(sort $(BUSYBOX_FINAL_DEPENDENCIES) $(BUSYBOX_FINAL_PATCH_DEPENDENCIES))
- BUSYBOX_FINAL_DEPENDENCIES=$(sort $(BUSYBOX_DEPENDENCIES))
- BUSYBOX_FINAL_PATCH_DEPENDENCIES=$(sort $(BUSYBOX_PATCH_DEPENDENCIES))
- BUSYBOX_RDEPENDENCIES=ncurses util-linux
-
-The output of quoted variables can be reused in shell scripts, for
-example:
-
- $ eval $(make -s printvars VARS=BUSYBOX_DEPENDENCIES QUOTED_VARS=YES)
- $ echo $BUSYBOX_DEPENDENCIES
- skeleton toolchain
-
-8.2.Understanding when a full rebuild is necessary
-
-Buildroot does not attempt to detect what parts of the system should
-be rebuilt when the system configuration is changed through make
-menuconfig, make xconfig or one of the other configuration tools. In
-some cases, Buildroot should rebuild the entire system, in some
-cases, only a specific subset of packages. But detecting this in a
-completely reliable manner is very difficult, and therefore the
-Buildroot developers have decided to simply not attempt to do this.
-
-Instead, it is the responsibility of the user to know when a full
-rebuild is necessary. As a hint, here are a few rules of thumb that
-can help you understand how to work with Buildroot:
-
-  * When the target architecture configuration is changed, a complete
-    rebuild is needed. Changing the architecture variant, the binary
-    format or the floating point strategy for example has an impact
-    on the entire system.
-  * When the toolchain configuration is changed, a complete rebuild
-    generally is needed. Changing the toolchain configuration often
-    involves changing the compiler version, the type of C library or
-    its configuration, or some other fundamental configuration item,
-    and these changes have an impact on the entire system.
-  * When an additional package is added to the configuration, a full
-    rebuild is not necessarily needed. Buildroot will detect that
-    this package has never been built, and will build it. However, if
-    this package is a library that can optionally be used by packages
-    that have already been built, Buildroot will not automatically
-    rebuild those. Either you know which packages should be rebuilt,
-    and you can rebuild them manually, or you should do a full
-    rebuild. For example, lets suppose you have built a system with
-    the ctorrent package, but without openssl. Your system works, but
-    you realize you would like to have SSL support in ctorrent, so
-    you enable the openssl package in Buildroot configuration and
-    restart the build. Buildroot will detect that openssl should be
-    built and will be build it, but it will not detect that ctorrent
-    should be rebuilt to benefit from openssl to add OpenSSL support.
-    You will either have to do a full rebuild, or rebuild ctorrent
-    itself.
-  * When a package is removed from the configuration, Buildroot does
-    not do anything special. It does not remove the files installed
-    by this package from the target root filesystem or from the
-    toolchain sysroot. A full rebuild is needed to get rid of this
-    package. However, generally you dont necessarily need this
-    package to be removed right now: you can wait for the next lunch
-    break to restart the build from scratch.
-  * When the sub-options of a package are changed, the package is not
-    automatically rebuilt. After making such changes, rebuilding only
-    this package is often sufficient, unless enabling the package
-    sub-option adds some features to the package that are useful for
-    another package which has already been built. Again, Buildroot
-    does not track when a package should be rebuilt: once a package
-    has been built, it is never rebuilt unless explicitly told to do
-    so.
-  * When a change to the root filesystem skeleton is made, a full
-    rebuild is needed. However, when changes to the root filesystem
-    overlay, a post-build script or a post-image script are made,
-    there is no need for a full rebuild: a simple make invocation
-    will take the changes into account.
-  * When a package listed in FOO_DEPENDENCIES is rebuilt or removed,
-    the package foo is not automatically rebuilt. For example, if a
-    package bar is listed in FOO_DEPENDENCIES with FOO_DEPENDENCIES =
-    bar and the configuration of the bar package is changed, the
-    configuration change would not result in a rebuild of package foo
-    automatically. In this scenario, you may need to either rebuild
-    any packages in your build which reference bar in their
-    DEPENDENCIES, or perform a full rebuild to ensure any bar
-    dependent packages are up to date.
-
-Generally speaking, when youre facing a build error and youre
-unsure of the potential consequences of the configuration changes
-youve made, do a full rebuild. If you get the same build error, then
-you are sure that the error is not related to partial rebuilds of
-packages, and if this error occurs with packages from the official
-Buildroot, do not hesitate to report the problem! As your experience
-with Buildroot progresses, you will progressively learn when a full
-rebuild is really necessary, and you will save more and more time.
-
-For reference, a full rebuild is achieved by running:
-
-$ make clean all
-
-8.3.Understanding how to rebuild packages
-
-One of the most common questions asked by Buildroot users is how to
-rebuild a given package or how to remove a package without rebuilding
-everything from scratch.
-
-Removing a package is unsupported by Buildroot without rebuilding
-from scratch. This is because Buildroot doesnt keep track of which
-package installs what files in the output/staging and output/target
-directories, or which package would be compiled differently depending
-on the availability of another package.
-
-The easiest way to rebuild a single package from scratch is to remove
-its build directory in output/build. Buildroot will then re-extract,
-re-configure, re-compile and re-install this package from scratch.
-You can ask buildroot to do this with the make <package>-dirclean
-command.
-
-On the other hand, if you only want to restart the build process of a
-package from its compilation step, you can run make <package>
--rebuild. It will restart the compilation and installation of the
-package, but not from scratch: it basically re-executes make and make
-install inside the package, so it will only rebuild files that
-changed.
-
-If you want to restart the build process of a package from its
-configuration step, you can run make <package>-reconfigure. It will
-restart the configuration, compilation and installation of the
-package.
-
-While <package>-rebuild implies <package>-reinstall and <package>
--reconfigure implies <package>-rebuild, these targets as well as
-<package> only act on the said package, and do not trigger
-re-creating the root filesystem image. If re-creating the root
-filesystem in necessary, one should in addition run make or make all.
-
-Internally, Buildroot creates so-called stamp files to keep track of
-which build steps have been completed for each package. They are
-stored in the package build directory, output/build/<package>-
-<version>/ and are named .stamp_<step-name>. The commands detailed
-above simply manipulate these stamp files to force Buildroot to
-restart a specific set of steps of a package build process.
-
-Further details about package special make targets are explained in
-Section8.14.5, Package-specific make targets.
-
-8.4.Offline builds
-
-If you intend to do an offline build and just want to download all
-sources that you previously selected in the configurator (menuconfig,
-nconfig, xconfig or gconfig), then issue:
-
- $ make source
-
-You can now disconnect or copy the content of your dl directory to
-the build-host.
-
-8.5.Building out-of-tree
-
-As default, everything built by Buildroot is stored in the directory
-output in the Buildroot tree.
-
-Buildroot also supports building out of tree with a syntax similar to
-the Linux kernel. To use it, add O=<directory> to the make command
-line:
-
- $ make O=/tmp/build
-
-Or:
-
- $ cd /tmp/build; make O=$PWD -C path/to/buildroot
-
-All the output files will be located under /tmp/build. If the O path
-does not exist, Buildroot will create it.
-
-Note: the O path can be either an absolute or a relative path, but if
-its passed as a relative path, it is important to note that it is
-interpreted relative to the main Buildroot source directory, not the
-current working directory.
-
-When using out-of-tree builds, the Buildroot .config and temporary
-files are also stored in the output directory. This means that you
-can safely run multiple builds in parallel using the same source tree
-as long as they use unique output directories.
-
-For ease of use, Buildroot generates a Makefile wrapper in the output
-directory - so after the first run, you no longer need to pass O=<>
-and -C <>, simply run (in the output directory):
-
- $ make <target>
-
-8.6.Environment variables
-
-Buildroot also honors some environment variables, when they are
-passed to make or set in the environment:
-
-  * HOSTCXX, the host C++ compiler to use
-  * HOSTCC, the host C compiler to use
-  * UCLIBC_CONFIG_FILE=<path/to/.config>, path to the uClibc
-    configuration file, used to compile uClibc, if an internal
-    toolchain is being built. Note that the uClibc configuration file
-    can also be set from the configuration interface, so through the
-    Buildroot .config file; this is the recommended way of setting
-    it.
-  * BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FILE=<path/to/.config>, path to the BusyBox
-    configuration file. Note that the BusyBox configuration file can
-    also be set from the configuration interface, so through the
-    Buildroot .config file; this is the recommended way of setting
-    it.
-  * BR2_CCACHE_DIR to override the directory where Buildroot stores
-    the cached files when using ccache.
-  * BR2_DL_DIR to override the directory in which Buildroot stores/
-    retrieves downloaded files. Note that the Buildroot download
-    directory can also be set from the configuration interface, so
-    through the Buildroot .config file. See Section8.14.4, Location
-    of downloaded packages for more details on how you can set the
-    download directory.
-  * BR2_GRAPH_ALT, if set and non-empty, to use an alternate
-    color-scheme in build-time graphs
-  * BR2_GRAPH_OUT to set the filetype of generated graphs, either pdf
-    (the default), or png.
-  * BR2_GRAPH_DEPS_OPTS to pass extra options to the dependency
-    graph; see Section8.9, Graphing the dependencies between
-    packages for the accepted options
-  * BR2_GRAPH_DOT_OPTS is passed verbatim as options to the dot
-    utility to draw the dependency graph.
-  * BR2_GRAPH_SIZE_OPTS to pass extra options to the size graph; see
-    Section8.11, Graphing the filesystem size contribution of
-    packages for the acepted options
-
-An example that uses config files located in the toplevel directory
-and in your $HOME:
-
- $ make UCLIBC_CONFIG_FILE=uClibc.config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FILE=$HOME/bb.config
-
-If you want to use a compiler other than the default gcc or g++ for
-building helper-binaries on your host, then do
-
- $ make HOSTCXX=g++-4.3-HEAD HOSTCC=gcc-4.3-HEAD
-
-8.7.Dealing efficiently with filesystem images
-
-Filesystem images can get pretty big, depending on the filesystem you
-choose, the number of packages, whether you provisioned free space
-Yet, some locations in the filesystems images may just be empty (e.g.
-a long run of zeroes); such a file is called a sparse file.
-
-Most tools can handle sparse files efficiently, and will only store
-or write those parts of a sparse file that are not empty.
-
-For example:
-
-  * tar accepts the -S option to tell it to only store non-zero
-    blocks of sparse files:
-
-      + tar cf archive.tar -S [files] will efficiently store sparse
-        files in a tarball
-      + tar xf archive.tar -S will efficiently store sparse files
-        extracted from a tarball
-  * cp accepts the --sparse=WHEN option (WHEN is one of auto, never
-    or always):
-
-      + cp --sparse=always source.file dest.file will make dest.file
-        a sparse file if source.file has long runs of zeroes
-
-Other tools may have similar options. Please consult their respective
-man pages.
-
-You can use sparse files if you need to store the filesystem images
-(e.g. to transfer from one machine to another), or if you need to
-send them (e.g. to the Q&A team).
-
-Note however that flashing a filesystem image to a device while using
-the sparse mode of dd may result in a broken filesystem (e.g. the
-block bitmap of an ext2 filesystem may be corrupted; or, if you have
-sparse files in your filesystem, those parts may not be all-zeroes
-when read back). You should only use sparse files when handling files
-on the build machine, not when transferring them to an actual device
-that will be used on the target.
-
-8.8.Details about packages
-
-Buildroot can produce a JSON blurb that describes the set of enabled
-packages in the current configuration, together with their
-dependencies, licenses and other metadata. This JSON blurb is
-produced by using the show-info make target:
-
-make show-info
-
-Buildroot can also produce details about packages as HTML and JSON
-output using the pkg-stats make target. Amongst other things, these
-details include whether known CVEs (security vulnerabilities) affect
-the packages in your current configuration. It also shows if there is
-a newer upstream version for those packages.
-
-make pkg-stats
-
-8.9.Graphing the dependencies between packages
-
-One of Buildroots jobs is to know the dependencies between packages,
-and make sure they are built in the right order. These dependencies
-can sometimes be quite complicated, and for a given system, it is
-often not easy to understand why such or such package was brought
-into the build by Buildroot.
-
-In order to help understanding the dependencies, and therefore better
-understand what is the role of the different components in your
-embedded Linux system, Buildroot is capable of generating dependency
-graphs.
-
-To generate a dependency graph of the full system you have compiled,
-simply run:
-
-make graph-depends
-
-You will find the generated graph in output/graphs/graph-depends.pdf.
-
-If your system is quite large, the dependency graph may be too
-complex and difficult to read. It is therefore possible to generate
-the dependency graph just for a given package:
-
-make <pkg>-graph-depends
-
-You will find the generated graph in output/graph/<pkg>
--graph-depends.pdf.
-
-Note that the dependency graphs are generated using the dot tool from
-the Graphviz project, which you must have installed on your system to
-use this feature. In most distributions, it is available as the
-graphviz package.
-
-By default, the dependency graphs are generated in the PDF format.
-However, by passing the BR2_GRAPH_OUT environment variable, you can
-switch to other output formats, such as PNG, PostScript or SVG. All
-formats supported by the -T option of the dot tool are supported.
-
-BR2_GRAPH_OUT=svg make graph-depends
-
-The graph-depends behaviour can be controlled by setting options in
-the BR2_GRAPH_DEPS_OPTS environment variable. The accepted options
-are:
-
-  * --depth N, -d N, to limit the dependency depth to N levels. The
-    default, 0, means no limit.
-  * --stop-on PKG, -s PKG, to stop the graph on the package PKG. PKG
-    can be an actual package name, a glob, the keyword virtual (to
-    stop on virtual packages), or the keyword host (to stop on host
-    packages). The package is still present on the graph, but its
-    dependencies are not.
-  * --exclude PKG, -x PKG, like --stop-on, but also omits PKG from
-    the graph.
-  * --transitive, --no-transitive, to draw (or not) the transitive
-    dependencies. The default is to not draw transitive dependencies.
-  * --colors R,T,H, the comma-separated list of colors to draw the
-    root package (R), the target packages (T) and the host packages
-    (H). Defaults to: lightblue,grey,gainsboro
-
-BR2_GRAPH_DEPS_OPTS='-d 3 --no-transitive --colors=red,green,blue' make graph-depends
-
-8.10.Graphing the build duration
-
-When the build of a system takes a long time, it is sometimes useful
-to be able to understand which packages are the longest to build, to
-see if anything can be done to speed up the build. In order to help
-such build time analysis, Buildroot collects the build time of each
-step of each package, and allows to generate graphs from this data.
-
-To generate the build time graph after a build, run:
-
-make graph-build
-
-This will generate a set of files in output/graphs :
-
-  * build.hist-build.pdf, a histogram of the build time for each
-    package, ordered in the build order.
-  * build.hist-duration.pdf, a histogram of the build time for each
-    package, ordered by duration (longest first)
-  * build.hist-name.pdf, a histogram of the build time for each
-    package, order by package name.
-  * build.pie-packages.pdf, a pie chart of the build time per package
-  * build.pie-steps.pdf, a pie chart of the global time spent in each
-    step of the packages build process.
-
-This graph-build target requires the Python Matplotlib and Numpy
-libraries to be installed (python-matplotlib and python-numpy on most
-distributions), and also the argparse module if youre using a Python
-version older than 2.7 (python-argparse on most distributions).
-
-By default, the output format for the graph is PDF, but a different
-format can be selected using the BR2_GRAPH_OUT environment variable.
-The only other format supported is PNG:
-
-BR2_GRAPH_OUT=png make graph-build
-
-8.11.Graphing the filesystem size contribution of packages
-
-When your target system grows, it is sometimes useful to understand
-how much each Buildroot package is contributing to the overall root
-filesystem size. To help with such an analysis, Buildroot collects
-data about files installed by each package and using this data,
-generates a graph and CSV files detailing the size contribution of
-the different packages.
-
-To generate these data after a build, run:
-
-make graph-size
-
-This will generate:
-
-  * output/graphs/graph-size.pdf, a pie chart of the contribution of
-    each package to the overall root filesystem size
-  * output/graphs/package-size-stats.csv, a CSV file giving the size
-    contribution of each package to the overall root filesystem size
-  * output/graphs/file-size-stats.csv, a CSV file giving the size
-    contribution of each installed file to the package it belongs,
-    and to the overall filesystem size.
-
-This graph-size target requires the Python Matplotlib library to be
-installed (python-matplotlib on most distributions), and also the
-argparse module if youre using a Python version older than 2.7
-(python-argparse on most distributions).
-
-Just like for the duration graph, a BR2_GRAPH_OUT environment
-variable is supported to adjust the output file format. See
-Section8.9, Graphing the dependencies between packages for details
-about this environment variable.
-
-Additionally, one may set the environment variable
-BR2_GRAPH_SIZE_OPTS to further control the generated graph. Accepted
-options are:
-
-  * --size-limit X, -l X, will group all packages which individual
-    contribution is below X percent, to a single entry labelled 
-    Others in the graph. By default, X=0.01, which means packages
-    each contributing less than 1% are grouped under Others. Accepted
-    values are in the range [0.0..1.0].
-  * --iec, --binary, --si, --decimal, to use IEC (binary, powers of
-    1024) or SI (decimal, powers of 1000; the default) prefixes.
-  * --biggest-first, to sort packages in decreasing size order,
-    rather than in increasing size order.
-
-Note.The collected filesystem size data is only meaningful after a
-complete clean rebuild. Be sure to run make clean all before using
-make graph-size.
-
-To compare the root filesystem size of two different Buildroot
-compilations, for example after adjusting the configuration or when
-switching to another Buildroot release, use the size-stats-compare
-script. It takes two file-size-stats.csv files (produced by make
-graph-size) as input. Refer to the help text of this script for more
-details:
-
-utils/size-stats-compare -h
-
-8.12.Top-level parallel build
-
-Note.This section deals with a very experimental feature, which is
-known to break even in some non-unusual situations. Use at your own
-risk.
-
-Buildroot has always been capable of using parallel build on a per
-package basis: each package is built by Buildroot using make -jN (or
-the equivalent invocation for non-make-based build systems). The
-level of parallelism is by default number of CPUs + 1, but it can be
-adjusted using the BR2_JLEVEL configuration option.
-
-Until 2020.02, Buildroot was however building packages in a serial
-fashion: each package was built one after the other, without
-parallelization of the build between packages. As of 2020.02,
-Buildroot has experimental support for top-level parallel build,
-which allows some signicant build time savings by building packages
-that have no dependency relationship in parallel. This feature is
-however marked as experimental and is known not to work in some
-cases.
-
-In order to use top-level parallel build, one must:
-
- 1. Enable the option BR2_PER_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES in the Buildroot
-    configuration
- 2. Use make -jN when starting the Buildroot build
-
-Internally, the BR2_PER_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES will enable a mechanism
-called per-package directories, which will have the following
-effects:
-
-  * Instead of a global target directory and a global host directory
-    common to all packages, per-package target and host directories
-    will be used, in $(O)/per-package/<pkg>/target/ and $(O)/
-    per-package/<pkg>/host/ respectively. Those folders will be
-    populated from the corresponding folders of the package
-    dependencies at the beginning of <pkg> build. The compiler and
-    all other tools will therefore only be able to see and access
-    files installed by dependencies explicitly listed by <pkg>.
-  * At the end of the build, the global target and host directories
-    will be populated, located in $(O)/target and $(O)/host
-    respectively. This means that during the build, those folders
-    will be empty and its only at the very end of the build that
-    they will be populated.
-
-8.13.Integration with Eclipse
-
-While a part of the embedded Linux developers like classical text
-editors like Vim or Emacs, and command-line based interfaces, a
-number of other embedded Linux developers like richer graphical
-interfaces to do their development work. Eclipse being one of the
-most popular Integrated Development Environment, Buildroot integrates
-with Eclipse in order to ease the development work of Eclipse users.
-
-Our integration with Eclipse simplifies the compilation, remote
-execution and remote debugging of applications and libraries that are
-built on top of a Buildroot system. It does not integrate the
-Buildroot configuration and build processes themselves with Eclipse.
-Therefore, the typical usage model of our Eclipse integration would
-be:
-
-  * Configure your Buildroot system with make menuconfig, make
-    xconfig or any other configuration interface provided with
-    Buildroot.
-  * Build your Buildroot system by running make.
-  * Start Eclipse to develop, execute and debug your own custom
-    applications and libraries, that will rely on the libraries built
-    and installed by Buildroot.
-
-The Buildroot Eclipse integration installation process and usage is
-described in detail at https://github.com/mbats/
-eclipse-buildroot-bundle/wiki.
-
-8.14.Advanced usage
-
-8.14.1.Using the generated toolchain outside Buildroot
-
-You may want to compile, for your target, your own programs or other
-software that are not packaged in Buildroot. In order to do this you
-can use the toolchain that was generated by Buildroot.
-
-The toolchain generated by Buildroot is located by default in output/
-host/. The simplest way to use it is to add output/host/bin/ to your
-PATH environment variable and then to use ARCH-linux-gcc,
-ARCH-linux-objdump, ARCH-linux-ld, etc.
-
-Alternatively, Buildroot can also export the toolchain and the
-development files of all selected packages, as an SDK, by running the
-command make sdk. This generates a tarball of the content of the host
-directory output/host/, named <TARGET-TUPLE>_sdk-buildroot.tar.gz
-(which can be overriden by setting the environment variable
-BR2_SDK_PREFIX) and located in the output directory output/images/.
-
-This tarball can then be distributed to application developers, when
-they want to develop their applications that are not (yet) packaged
-as a Buildroot package.
-
-Upon extracting the SDK tarball, the user must run the script
-relocate-sdk.sh (located at the top directory of the SDK), to make
-sure all paths are updated with the new location.
-
-Alternatively, if you just want to prepare the SDK without generating
-the tarball (e.g. because you will just be moving the host directory,
-or will be generating the tarball on your own), Buildroot also allows
-you to just prepare the SDK with make prepare-sdk without actually
-generating a tarball.
-
-For your convenience, by selecting the option
-BR2_PACKAGE_HOST_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP, you can get a environment-setup
-script installed in output/host/ and therefore in your SDK. This
-script can be sourced with . your/sdk/path/environment-setup to
-export a number of environment variables that will help cross-compile
-your projects using the Buildroot SDK: the PATH will contain the SDK
-binaries, standard autotools variables will be defined with the
-appropriate values, and CONFIGURE_FLAGS will contain basic ./
-configure options to cross-compile autotools projects. It also
-provides some useful commands. Note however that once this script is
-sourced, the environment is setup only for cross-compilation, and no
-longer for native compilation.
-
-8.14.2.Using gdb in Buildroot
-
-Buildroot allows to do cross-debugging, where the debugger runs on
-the build machine and communicates with gdbserver on the target to
-control the execution of the program.
-
-To achieve this:
-
-  * If you are using an internal toolchain (built by Buildroot), you
-    must enable BR2_PACKAGE_HOST_GDB, BR2_PACKAGE_GDB and
-    BR2_PACKAGE_GDB_SERVER. This ensures that both the cross gdb and
-    gdbserver get built, and that gdbserver gets installed to your
-    target.
-  * If you are using an external toolchain, you should enable
-    BR2_TOOLCHAIN_EXTERNAL_GDB_SERVER_COPY, which will copy the
-    gdbserver included with the external toolchain to the target. If
-    your external toolchain does not have a cross gdb or gdbserver,
-    it is also possible to let Buildroot build them, by enabling the
-    same options as for the internal toolchain backend.
-
-Now, to start debugging a program called foo, you should run on the
-target:
-
-gdbserver :2345 foo
-
-This will cause gdbserver to listen on TCP port 2345 for a connection
-from the cross gdb.
-
-Then, on the host, you should start the cross gdb using the following
-command line:
-
-<buildroot>/output/host/bin/<tuple>-gdb -ix <buildroot>/output/staging/usr/share/buildroot/gdbinit foo
-
-Of course, foo must be available in the current directory, built with
-debugging symbols. Typically you start this command from the
-directory where foo is built (and not from output/target/ as the
-binaries in that directory are stripped).
-
-The <buildroot>/output/staging/usr/share/buildroot/gdbinit file will
-tell the cross gdb where to find the libraries of the target.
-
-Finally, to connect to the target from the cross gdb:
-
-(gdb) target remote <target ip address>:2345
-
-8.14.3.Using ccache in Buildroot
-
-ccache [http://ccache.samba.org] is a compiler cache. It stores the
-object files resulting from each compilation process, and is able to
-skip future compilation of the same source file (with same compiler
-and same arguments) by using the pre-existing object files. When
-doing almost identical builds from scratch a number of times, it can
-nicely speed up the build process.
-
-ccache support is integrated in Buildroot. You just have to enable
-Enable compiler cache in Build options. This will automatically build
-ccache and use it for every host and target compilation.
-
-The cache is located in $HOME/.buildroot-ccache. It is stored outside
-of Buildroot output directory so that it can be shared by separate
-Buildroot builds. If you want to get rid of the cache, simply remove
-this directory.
-
-You can get statistics on the cache (its size, number of hits,
-misses, etc.) by running make ccache-stats.
-
-The make target ccache-options and the CCACHE_OPTIONS variable
-provide more generic access to the ccache. For example
-
-# set cache limit size
-make CCACHE_OPTIONS="--max-size=5G" ccache-options
-
-# zero statistics counters
-make CCACHE_OPTIONS="--zero-stats" ccache-options
-
-ccache makes a hash of the source files and of the compiler options.
-If a compiler option is different, the cached object file will not be
-used. Many compiler options, however, contain an absolute path to the
-staging directory. Because of this, building in a different output
-directory would lead to many cache misses.
-
-To avoid this issue, buildroot has the Use relative paths option
-(BR2_CCACHE_USE_BASEDIR). This will rewrite all absolute paths that
-point inside the output directory into relative paths. Thus, changing
-the output directory no longer leads to cache misses.
-
-A disadvantage of the relative paths is that they also end up to be
-relative paths in the object file. Therefore, for example, the
-debugger will no longer find the file, unless you cd to the output
-directory first.
-
-See the ccache manuals section on "Compiling in different
-directories" [https://ccache.samba.org/manual.html#
-_compiling_in_different_directories] for more details about this
-rewriting of absolute paths.
-
-8.14.4.Location of downloaded packages
-
-The various tarballs that are downloaded by Buildroot are all stored
-in BR2_DL_DIR, which by default is the dl directory. If you want to
-keep a complete version of Buildroot which is known to be working
-with the associated tarballs, you can make a copy of this directory.
-This will allow you to regenerate the toolchain and the target
-filesystem with exactly the same versions.
-
-If you maintain several Buildroot trees, it might be better to have a
-shared download location. This can be achieved by pointing the
-BR2_DL_DIR environment variable to a directory. If this is set, then
-the value of BR2_DL_DIR in the Buildroot configuration is overridden.
-The following line should be added to <~/.bashrc>.
-
- export BR2_DL_DIR=<shared download location>
-
-The download location can also be set in the .config file, with the
-BR2_DL_DIR option. Unlike most options in the .config file, this
-value is overridden by the BR2_DL_DIR environment variable.
-
-8.14.5.Package-specific make targets
-
-Running make <package> builds and installs that particular package
-and its dependencies.
-
-For packages relying on the Buildroot infrastructure, there are
-numerous special make targets that can be called independently like
-this:
-
-make <package>-<target>
-
-The package build targets are (in the order they are executed):
-
-+------------------------------------------------------------+

-8.14.6.Using Buildroot during development
-
-The normal operation of Buildroot is to download a tarball, extract
-it, configure, compile and install the software component found
-inside this tarball. The source code is extracted in output/build/
-<package>-<version>, which is a temporary directory: whenever make
-clean is used, this directory is entirely removed, and re-created at
-the next make invocation. Even when a Git or Subversion repository is
-used as the input for the package source code, Buildroot creates a
-tarball out of it, and then behaves as it normally does with
-tarballs.
-
-This behavior is well-suited when Buildroot is used mainly as an
-integration tool, to build and integrate all the components of an
-embedded Linux system. However, if one uses Buildroot during the
-development of certain components of the system, this behavior is not
-very convenient: one would instead like to make a small change to the
-source code of one package, and be able to quickly rebuild the system
-with Buildroot.
-
-Making changes directly in output/build/<package>-<version> is not an
-appropriate solution, because this directory is removed on make
-clean.
-
-Therefore, Buildroot provides a specific mechanism for this use case:
-the <pkg>_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR mechanism. Buildroot reads an override
-file, which allows the user to tell Buildroot the location of the
-source for certain packages.
-
-The default location of the override file is $(CONFIG_DIR)/local.mk,
-as defined by the BR2_PACKAGE_OVERRIDE_FILE configuration option. $
-(CONFIG_DIR) is the location of the Buildroot .config file, so
-local.mk by default lives side-by-side with the .config file, which
-means:
-
-  * In the top-level Buildroot source directory for in-tree builds
-    (i.e., when O= is not used)
-  * In the out-of-tree directory for out-of-tree builds (i.e., when O
-    = is used)
-
-If a different location than these defaults is required, it can be
-specified through the BR2_PACKAGE_OVERRIDE_FILE configuration option.
-
-In this override file, Buildroot expects to find lines of the form:
-
-<pkg1>_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR = /path/to/pkg1/sources
-<pkg2>_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR = /path/to/pkg2/sources
-
-For example:
-
-LINUX_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR = /home/bob/linux/
-BUSYBOX_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR = /home/bob/busybox/
-
-When Buildroot finds that for a given package, an <pkg>
-_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR has been defined, it will no longer attempt to
-download, extract and patch the package. Instead, it will directly
-use the source code available in the specified directory and make
-clean will not touch this directory. This allows to point Buildroot
-to your own directories, that can be managed by Git, Subversion, or
-any other version control system. To achieve this, Buildroot will use
-rsync to copy the source code of the component from the specified
-<pkg>_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR to output/build/<package>-custom/.
-
-This mechanism is best used in conjunction with the make <pkg>
--rebuild and make <pkg>-reconfigure targets. A make <pkg>-rebuild all
-sequence will rsync the source code from <pkg>_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR to
-output/build/<package>-custom (thanks to rsync, only the modified
-files are copied), and restart the build process of just this
-package.
-
-In the example of the linux package above, the developer can then
-make a source code change in /home/bob/linux and then run:
-
-make linux-rebuild all
-
-and in a matter of seconds gets the updated Linux kernel image in
-output/images. Similarly, a change can be made to the BusyBox source
-code in /home/bob/busybox, and after:
-
-make busybox-rebuild all
-
-the root filesystem image in output/images contains the updated
-BusyBox.
-
-Source trees for big projects often contain hundreds or thousands of
-files which are not needed for building, but will slow down the
-process of copying the sources with rsync. Optionally, it is possible
-define <pkg>_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR_RSYNC_EXCLUSIONS to skip syncing certain
-files from the source tree. For example, when working on the
-webkitgtk package, the following will exclude the tests and in-tree
-builds from a local WebKit source tree:
-
-WEBKITGTK_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR = /home/bob/WebKit
-WEBKITGTK_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR_RSYNC_EXCLUSIONS = \
-        --exclude JSTests --exclude ManualTests --exclude PerformanceTests \
-        --exclude WebDriverTests --exclude WebKitBuild --exclude WebKitLibraries \
-        --exclude WebKit.xcworkspace --exclude Websites --exclude Examples
-
-By default, Buildroot skips syncing of VCS artifacts (e.g., the .git
-and .svn directories). Some packages prefer to have these VCS
-directories available during build, for example for automatically
-determining a precise commit reference for version information. To
-undo this built-in filtering at a cost of a slower speed, add these
-directories back:
-
-LINUX_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR_RSYNC_EXCLUSIONS = --include .git
-
-Chapter9.Project-specific customization
-
-Typical actions you may need to perform for a given project are:
-
-  * configuring Buildroot (including build options and toolchain,
-    bootloader, kernel, package and filesystem image type selection)
-  * configuring other components, like the Linux kernel and BusyBox
-  * customizing the generated target filesystem
-
-      + adding or overwriting files on the target filesystem (using
-        BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY)
-      + modifying or deleting files on the target filesystem (using
-        BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT)
-      + running arbitrary commands prior to generating the filesystem
-        image (using BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT)
-      + setting file permissions and ownership (using
-        BR2_ROOTFS_DEVICE_TABLE)
-      + adding custom devices nodes (using
-        BR2_ROOTFS_STATIC_DEVICE_TABLE)
-  * adding custom user accounts (using BR2_ROOTFS_USERS_TABLES)
-  * running arbitrary commands after generating the filesystem image
-    (using BR2_ROOTFS_POST_IMAGE_SCRIPT)
-  * adding project-specific patches to some packages (using
-    BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR)
-  * adding project-specific packages
-
-An important note regarding such project-specific customizations:
-please carefully consider which changes are indeed project-specific
-and which changes are also useful to developers outside your project.
-The Buildroot community highly recommends and encourages the
-upstreaming of improvements, packages and board support to the
-official Buildroot project. Of course, it is sometimes not possible
-or desirable to upstream because the changes are highly specific or
-proprietary.
-
-This chapter describes how to make such project-specific
-customizations in Buildroot and how to store them in a way that you
-can build the same image in a reproducible way, even after running 
-make clean. By following the recommended strategy, you can even use
-the same Buildroot tree to build multiple distinct projects!
-
-9.1.Recommended directory structure
-
-When customizing Buildroot for your project, you will be creating one
-or more project-specific files that need to be stored somewhere.
-While most of these files could be placed in any location as their
-path is to be specified in the Buildroot configuration, the Buildroot
-developers recommend a specific directory structure which is
-described in this section.
-
-Orthogonal to this directory structure, you can choose where you
-place this structure itself: either inside the Buildroot tree, or
-outside of it using a br2-external tree. Both options are valid, the
-choice is up to you.
-
-+-- board/
-|   +-- <company>/
-|       +-- <boardname>/
-|           +-- linux.config
-|           +-- busybox.config
-|           +-- <other configuration files>
-|           +-- post_build.sh
-|           +-- post_image.sh
-|           +-- rootfs_overlay/
-|           |   +-- etc/
-|           |   +-- <some file>
-|           +-- patches/
-|               +-- foo/
-|               |   +-- <some patch>
-|               +-- libbar/
-|                   +-- <some other patches>
-|
-+-- configs/
-|   +-- <boardname>_defconfig
-|
-+-- package/
-|   +-- <company>/
-|       +-- Config.in (if not using a br2-external tree)
-|       +-- <company>.mk (if not using a br2-external tree)
-|       +-- package1/
-|       |    +-- Config.in
-|       |    +-- package1.mk
-|       +-- package2/
-|           +-- Config.in
-|           +-- package2.mk
-|
-+-- Config.in (if using a br2-external tree)
-+-- external.mk (if using a br2-external tree)
-+-- external.desc (if using a br2-external tree)
-
-Details on the files shown above are given further in this chapter.
-
-Note: if you choose to place this structure outside of the Buildroot
-tree but in a br2-external tree, the <company> and possibly
-<boardname> components may be superfluous and can be left out.
-
-9.1.1.Implementing layered customizations
-
-It is quite common for a user to have several related projects that
-partly need the same customizations. Instead of duplicating these
-customizations for each project, it is recommended to use a layered
-customization approach, as explained in this section.
-
-Almost all of the customization methods available in Buildroot, like
-post-build scripts and root filesystem overlays, accept a
-space-separated list of items. The specified items are always treated
-in order, from left to right. By creating more than one such item,
-one for the common customizations and another one for the really
-project-specific customizations, you can avoid unnecessary
-duplication. Each layer is typically embodied by a separate directory
-inside board/<company>/. Depending on your projects, you could even
-introduce more than two layers.
-
-An example directory structure for where a user has two customization
-layers common and fooboard is:
-
-+-- board/
-    +-- <company>/
-        +-- common/
-        |   +-- post_build.sh
-        |   +-- rootfs_overlay/
-        |   |   +-- ...
-        |   +-- patches/
-        |       +-- ...
-        |
-        +-- fooboard/
-            +-- linux.config
-            +-- busybox.config
-            +-- <other configuration files>
-            +-- post_build.sh
-            +-- rootfs_overlay/
-            |   +-- ...
-            +-- patches/
-                +-- ...
-
-For example, if the user has the BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR configuration
-option set as:
-
-BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR="board/<company>/common/patches board/<company>/fooboard/patches"
-
-then first the patches from the common layer would be applied,
-followed by the patches from the fooboard layer.
-
-9.2.Keeping customizations outside of Buildroot
-
-As already briefly mentioned in Section9.1, Recommended directory
-structure, you can place project-specific customizations in two
-locations:
-
-  * directly within the Buildroot tree, typically maintaining them
-    using branches in a version control system so that upgrading to a
-    newer Buildroot release is easy.
-  * outside of the Buildroot tree, using the br2-external mechanism.
-    This mechanism allows to keep package recipes, board support and
-    configuration files outside of the Buildroot tree, while still
-    having them nicely integrated in the build logic. We call this
-    location a br2-external tree. This section explains how to use
-    the br2-external mechanism and what to provide in a br2-external
-    tree.
-
-One can tell Buildroot to use one or more br2-external trees by
-setting the BR2_EXTERNAL make variable set to the path(s) of the
-br2-external tree(s) to use. It can be passed to any Buildroot make
-invocation. It is automatically saved in the hidden .br2-external.mk
-file in the output directory. Thanks to this, there is no need to
-pass BR2_EXTERNAL at every make invocation. It can however be changed
-at any time by passing a new value, and can be removed by passing an
-empty value.
-
-Note.The path to a br2-external tree can be either absolute or
-relative. If it is passed as a relative path, it is important to note
-that it is interpreted relative to the main Buildroot source
-directory, not to the Buildroot output directory.
-
-Note:If using an br2-external tree from before Buildroot 2016.11,
-you need to convert it before you can use it with Buildroot 2016.11
-onward. See Section27.2, Migrating to 2016.11 for help on doing
-so.
-
-Some examples:
-
-buildroot/ $ make BR2_EXTERNAL=/path/to/foo menuconfig
-
-From now on, definitions from the /path/to/foo br2-external tree will
-be used:
-
-buildroot/ $ make
-buildroot/ $ make legal-info
-
-We can switch to another br2-external tree at any time:
-
-buildroot/ $ make BR2_EXTERNAL=/where/we/have/bar xconfig
-
-We can also use multiple br2-external trees:
-
-buildroot/ $ make BR2_EXTERNAL=/path/to/foo:/where/we/have/bar menuconfig
-
-Or disable the usage of any br2-external tree:
-
-buildroot/ $ make BR2_EXTERNAL= xconfig
-
-9.2.1.Layout of a br2-external tree
-
-A br2-external tree must contain at least those three files,
-described in the following chapters:
-
-  * external.desc
-  * external.mk
-  * Config.in
-
-Apart from those mandatory files, there may be additional and
-optional content that may be present in a br2-external tree, like the
-configs/ or provides/ directories. They are described in the
-following chapters as well.
-
-A complete example br2-external tree layout is also described later.
-
-9.2.1.1.The external.desc file
-
-That file describes the br2-external tree: the name and description
-for that br2-external tree.
-
-The format for this file is line based, with each line starting by a
-keyword, followed by a colon and one or more spaces, followed by the
-value assigned to that keyword. There are two keywords currently
-recognised:
-
-  * name, mandatory, defines the name for that br2-external tree.
-    That name must only use ASCII characters in the set [A-Za-z0-9_];
-    any other character is forbidden. Buildroot sets the variable
-    BR2_EXTERNAL_$(NAME)_PATH to the absolute path of the
-    br2-external tree, so that you can use it to refer to your
-    br2-external tree. This variable is available both in Kconfig, so
-    you can use it to source your Kconfig files (see below) and in
-    the Makefile, so that you can use it to include other Makefiles
-    (see below) or refer to other files (like data files) from your
-    br2-external tree.
-
-    Note:Since it is possible to use multiple br2-external trees at
-    once, this name is used by Buildroot to generate variables for
-    each of those trees. That name is used to identify your
-    br2-external tree, so try to come up with a name that really
-    describes your br2-external tree, in order for it to be
-    relatively unique, so that it does not clash with another name
-    from another br2-external tree, especially if you are planning on
-    somehow sharing your br2-external tree with third parties or
-    using br2-external trees from third parties.
-
-  * desc, optional, provides a short description for that
-    br2-external tree. It shall fit on a single line, is mostly
-    free-form (see below), and is used when displaying information
-    about a br2-external tree (e.g. above the list of defconfig
-    files, or as the prompt in the menuconfig); as such, it should
-    relatively brief (40 chars is probably a good upper limit). The
-    description is available in the BR2_EXTERNAL_$(NAME)_DESC
-    variable.
-
-Examples of names and the corresponding BR2_EXTERNAL_$(NAME)_PATH
-variables:
-
-  * FOO  BR2_EXTERNAL_FOO_PATH
-  * BAR_42  BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH
-
-In the following examples, it is assumed the name to be set to
-BAR_42.
-
-Note:Both BR2_EXTERNAL_$(NAME)_PATH and BR2_EXTERNAL_$(NAME)_DESC
-are available in the Kconfig files and the Makefiles. They are also
-exported in the environment so are available in post-build,
-post-image and in-fakeroot scripts.
-
-9.2.1.2.The Config.in and external.mk files
-
-Those files (which may each be empty) can be used to define package
-recipes (i.e. foo/Config.in and foo/foo.mk like for packages bundled
-in Buildroot itself) or other custom configuration options or make
-logic.
-
-Buildroot automatically includes the Config.in from each br2-external
-tree to make it appear in the top-level configuration menu, and
-includes the external.mk from each br2-external tree with the rest of
-the makefile logic.
-
-The main usage of this is to store package recipes. The recommended
-way to do this is to write a Config.in file that looks like:
-
-source "$BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH/package/package1/Config.in"
-source "$BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH/package/package2/Config.in"
-
-Then, have an external.mk file that looks like:
-
-include $(sort $(wildcard $(BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH)/package/*/*.mk))
-
-And then in $(BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH)/package/package1 and $
-(BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH)/package/package2 create normal Buildroot
-package recipes, as explained in Chapter18, Adding new packages to
-Buildroot. If you prefer, you can also group the packages in
-subdirectories called <boardname> and adapt the above paths
-accordingly.
-
-You can also define custom configuration options in Config.in and
-custom make logic in external.mk.
-
-9.2.1.3.The configs/ directory
-
-One can store Buildroot defconfigs in the configs subdirectory of the
-br2-external tree. Buildroot will automatically show them in the
-output of make list-defconfigs and allow them to be loaded with the
-normal make <name>_defconfig command. They will be visible in the 
-make list-defconfigs output, below an External configs label that
-contains the name of the br2-external tree they are defined in.
-
-Note:If a defconfig file is present in more than one br2-external
-tree, then the one from the last br2-external tree is used. It is
-thus possible to override a defconfig bundled in Buildroot or another
-br2-external tree.
-
-9.2.1.4.The provides/ directory
-
-For some packages, Buildroot provides a choice between two (or more)
-implementations of API-compatible such packages. For example, there
-is a choice to choose either libjpeg ot jpeg-turbo; there is one
-between openssl or libressl; there is one to select one of the known,
-pre-configured toolchains
-
-It is possible for a br2-external to extend those choices, by
-providing a set of files that define those alternatives:
-
-  * provides/toolchains.in defines the pre-configured toolchains,
-    which will then be listed in the toolchain selection;
-  * provides/jpeg.in defines the alternative libjpeg implementations;
-  * provides/openssl.in defines the alternative openssl
-    implementations;
-  * provides/skeleton.in defines the alternative skeleton
-    implementations;
-  * provides/init.in defines the alternative init system
-    implementations, this can be used to select a default skeleton
-    for your init.
-
-9.2.1.5.Free-form content
-
-One can store all the board-specific configuration files there, such
-as the kernel configuration, the root filesystem overlay, or any
-other configuration file for which Buildroot allows to set the
-location (by using the BR2_EXTERNAL_$(NAME)_PATH variable). For
-example, you could set the paths to a global patch directory, to a
-rootfs overlay and to the kernel configuration file as follows (e.g.
-by running make menuconfig and filling in these options):
-
-BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR=$(BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH)/patches/
-BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY=$(BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH)/board/<boardname>/overlay/
-BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE=$(BR2_EXTERNAL_BAR_42_PATH)/board/<boardname>/kernel.config
-
-9.2.1.6.Additional Linux kernel extensions
-
-Additional Linux kernel extensions (see Section18.21.2,
-linux-kernel-extensions) can be added by storing them in the linux/
-directory at the root of a br2-external tree.
-
-9.2.1.7.Example layout
-
-Here is an example layout using all features of br2-external (the
-sample content is shown for the file above it, when it is relevant to
-explain the br2-external tree; this is all entirely made up just for
-the sake of illustration, of course):

-    [ ] pkg-1
-    [ ] pkg-2
-    (0x10AD) my-board flash address
-
-If you are using more than one br2-external tree, it would look like
-(with the layout expanded and the second one with name FOO_27 but no

-Note.The toolchain options in toolchain/toolchain-external-mine/
-Config.in.options will not appear in the Toolchain menu. They must be
-explicitly included from within the br2-externals top-level
-Config.in and will thus appear in the External options menu.
-
-9.3.Storing the Buildroot configuration
-
-The Buildroot configuration can be stored using the command make
-savedefconfig.
-
-This strips the Buildroot configuration down by removing
-configuration options that are at their default value. The result is
-stored in a file called defconfig. If you want to save it in another
-place, change the BR2_DEFCONFIG option in the Buildroot configuration
-itself, or call make with make savedefconfig BR2_DEFCONFIG=
-<path-to-defconfig>.
-
-The recommended place to store this defconfig is configs/<boardname>
-_defconfig. If you follow this recommendation, the configuration will
-be listed in make help and can be set again by running make
-<boardname>_defconfig.
-
-Alternatively, you can copy the file to any other place and rebuild
-with make defconfig BR2_DEFCONFIG=<path-to-defconfig-file>.
-
-9.4.Storing the configuration of other components
-
-The configuration files for BusyBox, the Linux kernel, Barebox,
-U-Boot and uClibc should be stored as well if changed. For each of
-these components, a Buildroot configuration option exists to point to
-an input configuration file, e.g.
-BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE. To store their configuration,
-set these configuration options to a path where you want to save the
-configuration files, and then use the helper targets described below
-to actually store the configuration.
-
-As explained in Section9.1, Recommended directory structure, the
-recommended path to store these configuration files is board/
-<company>/<boardname>/foo.config.
-
-Make sure that you create a configuration file before changing the
-BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE etc. options. Otherwise,
-Buildroot will try to access this config file, which doesnt exist
-yet, and will fail. You can create the configuration file by running
-make linux-menuconfig etc.
-
-Buildroot provides a few helper targets to make the saving of
-configuration files easier.
-
-  * make linux-update-defconfig saves the linux configuration to the
-    path specified by BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE. It
-    simplifies the config file by removing default values. However,
-    this only works with kernels starting from 2.6.33. For earlier
-    kernels, use make linux-update-config.
-  * make busybox-update-config saves the busybox configuration to the
-    path specified by BR2_PACKAGE_BUSYBOX_CONFIG.
-  * make uclibc-update-config saves the uClibc configuration to the
-    path specified by BR2_UCLIBC_CONFIG.
-  * make barebox-update-defconfig saves the barebox configuration to
-    the path specified by BR2_TARGET_BAREBOX_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE.
-  * make uboot-update-defconfig saves the U-Boot configuration to the
-    path specified by BR2_TARGET_UBOOT_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE.
-  * For at91bootstrap3, no helper exists so you have to copy the
-    config file manually to
-    BR2_TARGET_AT91BOOTSTRAP3_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE.
-
-9.5.Customizing the generated target filesystem
-
-Besides changing the configuration through make *config, there are a
-few other ways to customize the resulting target filesystem.
-
-The two recommended methods, which can co-exist, are root filesystem
-overlay(s) and post build script(s).
-
-Root filesystem overlays (BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY)
-
-    A filesystem overlay is a tree of files that is copied directly
-    over the target filesystem after it has been built. To enable
-    this feature, set config option BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY (in the System
-    configuration menu) to the root of the overlay. You can even
-    specify multiple overlays, space-separated. If you specify a
-    relative path, it will be relative to the root of the Buildroot
-    tree. Hidden directories of version control systems, like .git,
-    .svn, .hg, etc., files called .empty and files ending in ~ are
-    excluded from the copy.
-
-    When BR2_ROOTFS_MERGED_USR is enabled, then the overlay must not
-    contain the /bin, /lib or /sbin directories, as Buildroot will
-    create them as symbolic links to the relevant folders in /usr. In
-    such a situation, should the overlay have any programs or
-    libraries, they should be placed in /usr/bin, /usr/sbin and /usr/
-    lib.
-
-    As shown in Section9.1, Recommended directory structure, the
-    recommended path for this overlay is board/<company>/<boardname>/
-    rootfs-overlay.
-
-Post-build scripts (BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT)
-
-    Post-build scripts are shell scripts called after Buildroot
-    builds all the selected software, but before the rootfs images
-    are assembled. To enable this feature, specify a space-separated
-    list of post-build scripts in config option
-    BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT (in the System configuration menu).
-    If you specify a relative path, it will be relative to the root
-    of the Buildroot tree.
-
-    Using post-build scripts, you can remove or modify any file in
-    your target filesystem. You should, however, use this feature
-    with care. Whenever you find that a certain package generates
-    wrong or unneeded files, you should fix that package rather than
-    work around it with some post-build cleanup scripts.
-
-    As shown in Section9.1, Recommended directory structure, the
-    recommended path for this script is board/<company>/<boardname>/
-    post_build.sh.
-
-    The post-build scripts are run with the main Buildroot tree as
-    current working directory. The path to the target filesystem is
-    passed as the first argument to each script. If the config option
-    BR2_ROOTFS_POST_SCRIPT_ARGS is not empty, these arguments will be
-    passed to the script too. All the scripts will be passed the
-    exact same set of arguments, it is not possible to pass different
-    sets of arguments to each script.
-
-    In addition, you may also use these environment variables:
-
-      + BR2_CONFIG: the path to the Buildroot .config file
-      + CONFIG_DIR: the directory containing the .config file, and
-        therefore the top-level Buildroot Makefile to use (which is
-        correct for both in-tree and out-of-tree builds)
-      + HOST_DIR, STAGING_DIR, TARGET_DIR: see Section18.5.2,
-        generic-package reference
-      + BUILD_DIR: the directory where packages are extracted and
-        built
-      + BINARIES_DIR: the place where all binary files (aka images)
-        are stored
-      + BASE_DIR: the base output directory
-
-Below three more methods of customizing the target filesystem are
-described, but they are not recommended.
-
-Direct modification of the target filesystem
-
-    For temporary modifications, you can modify the target filesystem
-    directly and rebuild the image. The target filesystem is
-    available under output/target/. After making your changes, run
-    make to rebuild the target filesystem image.
-
-    This method allows you to do anything to the target filesystem,
-    but if you need to clean your Buildroot tree using make clean,
-    these changes will be lost. Such cleaning is necessary in several
-    cases, refer to Section8.2, Understanding when a full rebuild
-    is necessary for details. This solution is therefore only useful
-    for quick tests: changes do not survive the make clean command.
-    Once you have validated your changes, you should make sure that
-    they will persist after a make clean, using a root filesystem
-    overlay or a post-build script.
-
-Custom target skeleton (BR2_ROOTFS_SKELETON_CUSTOM)
-
-    The root filesystem image is created from a target skeleton, on
-    top of which all packages install their files. The skeleton is
-    copied to the target directory output/target before any package
-    is built and installed. The default target skeleton provides the
-    standard Unix filesystem layout and some basic init scripts and
-    configuration files.
-
-    If the default skeleton (available under system/skeleton) does
-    not match your needs, you would typically use a root filesystem
-    overlay or post-build script to adapt it. However, if the default
-    skeleton is entirely different than what you need, using a custom
-    skeleton may be more suitable.
-
-    To enable this feature, enable config option
-    BR2_ROOTFS_SKELETON_CUSTOM and set
-    BR2_ROOTFS_SKELETON_CUSTOM_PATH to the path of your custom
-    skeleton. Both options are available in the System configuration
-    menu. If you specify a relative path, it will be relative to the
-    root of the Buildroot tree.
-
-    Custom skeletons dont need to contain the /bin, /lib or /sbin
-    directories, since they are created automatically during the
-    build. When BR2_ROOTFS_MERGED_USR is enabled, then the custom
-    skeleton must not contain the /bin, /lib or /sbin directories, as
-    Buildroot will create them as symbolic links to the relevant
-    folders in /usr. In such a situation, should the skeleton have
-    any programs or libraries, they should be placed in /usr/bin, /
-    usr/sbin and /usr/lib.
-
-    This method is not recommended because it duplicates the entire
-    skeleton, which prevents taking advantage of the fixes or
-    improvements brought to the default skeleton in later Buildroot
-    releases.
-
-Post-fakeroot scripts (BR2_ROOTFS_POST_FAKEROOT_SCRIPT)
-
-    When aggregating the final images, some parts of the process
-    requires root rights: creating device nodes in /dev, setting
-    permissions or ownership to files and directories To avoid
-    requiring actual root rights, Buildroot uses fakeroot to simulate
-    root rights. This is not a complete substitute for actually being
-    root, but is enough for what Buildroot needs.
-
-    Post-fakeroot scripts are shell scripts that are called at the 
-    end of the fakeroot phase, right before the filesystem image
-    generator is called. As such, they are called in the fakeroot
-    context.
-
-    Post-fakeroot scripts can be useful in case you need to tweak the
-    filesystem to do modifications that are usually only available to
-    the root user.
-
-    Note:It is recommended to use the existing mechanisms to set
-    file permissions or create entries in /dev (see Section9.5.1,
-    Setting file permissions and ownership and adding custom devices
-    nodes) or to create users (see Section9.6, Adding custom user
-    accounts)
-
-    Note:The difference between post-build scripts (above) and
-    fakeroot scripts, is that post-build scripts are not called in
-    the fakeroot context.
-
-    Note:Using fakeroot is not an absolute substitute for actually
-    being root. fakeroot only ever fakes the file access rights and
-    types (regular, block-or-char device) and uid/gid; these are
-    emulated in-memory.
-
-9.5.1.Setting file permissions and ownership and adding custom
-devices nodes
-
-Sometimes it is needed to set specific permissions or ownership on
-files or device nodes. For example, certain files may need to be
-owned by root. Since the post-build scripts are not run as root, you
-cannot do such changes from there unless you use an explicit fakeroot
-from the post-build script.
-
-Instead, Buildroot provides support for so-called permission tables.
-To use this feature, set config option BR2_ROOTFS_DEVICE_TABLE to a
-space-separated list of permission tables, regular text files
-following the makedev syntax.
-
-If you are using a static device table (i.e. not using devtmpfs,
-mdev, or (e)udev) then you can add device nodes using the same
-syntax, in so-called device tables. To use this feature, set config
-option BR2_ROOTFS_STATIC_DEVICE_TABLE to a space-separated list of
-device tables.
-
-As shown in Section9.1, Recommended directory structure, the
-recommended location for such files is board/<company>/<boardname>/.
-
-It should be noted that if the specific permissions or device nodes
-are related to a specific application, you should set variables
-FOO_PERMISSIONS and FOO_DEVICES in the packages .mk file instead
-(see Section18.5.2, generic-package reference).
-
-9.6.Adding custom user accounts
-
-Sometimes it is needed to add specific users in the target system. To
-cover this requirement, Buildroot provides support for so-called 
-users tables. To use this feature, set config option
-BR2_ROOTFS_USERS_TABLES to a space-separated list of users tables,
-regular text files following the makeusers syntax.
-
-As shown in Section9.1, Recommended directory structure, the
-recommended location for such files is board/<company>/<boardname>/.
-
-It should be noted that if the custom users are related to a specific
-application, you should set variable FOO_USERS in the packages .mk
-file instead (see Section18.5.2, generic-package reference).
-
-9.7.Customization after the images have been created
-
-While post-build scripts (Section9.5, Customizing the generated
-target filesystem) are run before building the filesystem image,
-kernel and bootloader, post-image scripts can be used to perform some
-specific actions after all images have been created.
-
-Post-image scripts can for example be used to automatically extract
-your root filesystem tarball in a location exported by your NFS
-server, or to create a special firmware image that bundles your root
-filesystem and kernel image, or any other custom action required for
-your project.
-
-To enable this feature, specify a space-separated list of post-image
-scripts in config option BR2_ROOTFS_POST_IMAGE_SCRIPT (in the System
-configuration menu). If you specify a relative path, it will be
-relative to the root of the Buildroot tree.
-
-Just like post-build scripts, post-image scripts are run with the
-main Buildroot tree as current working directory. The path to the
-images output directory is passed as the first argument to each
-script. If the config option BR2_ROOTFS_POST_SCRIPT_ARGS is not
-empty, these arguments will be passed to the script too. All the
-scripts will be passed the exact same set of arguments, it is not
-possible to pass different sets of arguments to each script.
-
-Again just like for the post-build scripts, the scripts have access
-to the environment variables BR2_CONFIG, HOST_DIR, STAGING_DIR,
-TARGET_DIR, BUILD_DIR, BINARIES_DIR, CONFIG_DIR and BASE_DIR.
-
-The post-image scripts will be executed as the user that executes
-Buildroot, which should normally not be the root user. Therefore, any
-action requiring root permissions in one of these scripts will
-require special handling (usage of fakeroot or sudo), which is left
-to the script developer.
-
-9.8.Adding project-specific patches
-
-It is sometimes useful to apply extra patches to packages - on top of
-those provided in Buildroot. This might be used to support custom
-features in a project, for example, or when working on a new
-architecture.
-
-The BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR configuration option can be used to specify
-a space separated list of one or more directories containing package
-patches.
-
-For a specific version <packageversion> of a specific package
-<packagename>, patches are applied from BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR as
-follows:
-
- 1. For every directory - <global-patch-dir> - that exists in
-    BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR, a <package-patch-dir> will be determined as
-    follows:
-
-      + <global-patch-dir>/<packagename>/<packageversion>/ if the
-        directory exists.
-      + Otherwise, <global-patch-dir>/<packagename> if the directory
-        exists.
- 2. Patches will then be applied from a <package-patch-dir> as
-    follows:
-
-      + If a series file exists in the package directory, then
-        patches are applied according to the series file;
-      + Otherwise, patch files matching *.patch are applied in
-        alphabetical order. So, to ensure they are applied in the
-        right order, it is highly recommended to name the patch files
-        like this: <number>-<description>.patch, where <number>
-        refers to the apply order.
-
-For information about how patches are applied for a package, see
-Section19.2, How patches are applied
-
-The BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR option is the preferred method for
-specifying a custom patch directory for packages. It can be used to
-specify a patch directory for any package in buildroot. It should
-also be used in place of the custom patch directory options that are
-available for packages such as U-Boot and Barebox. By doing this, it
-will allow a user to manage their patches from one top-level
-directory.
-
-The exception to BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR being the preferred method for
-specifying custom patches is BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_PATCH.
-BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_PATCH should be used to specify kernel patches that
-are available at a URL. Note: BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_PATCH specifies kernel
-patches that are applied after patches available in
-BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR, as it is done from a post-patch hook of the
-Linux package.
-
-9.9.Adding project-specific packages
-
-In general, any new package should be added directly in the package
-directory and submitted to the Buildroot upstream project. How to add
-packages to Buildroot in general is explained in full detail in
-Chapter18, Adding new packages to Buildroot and will not be repeated
-here. However, your project may need some proprietary packages that
-cannot be upstreamed. This section will explain how you can keep such
-project-specific packages in a project-specific directory.
-
-As shown in Section9.1, Recommended directory structure, the
-recommended location for project-specific packages is package/
-<company>/. If you are using the br2-external tree feature (see
-Section9.2, Keeping customizations outside of Buildroot) the
-recommended location is to put them in a sub-directory named package/
-in your br2-external tree.
-
-However, Buildroot will not be aware of the packages in this
-location, unless we perform some additional steps. As explained in
-Chapter18, Adding new packages to Buildroot, a package in Buildroot
-basically consists of two files: a .mk file (describing how to build
-the package) and a Config.in file (describing the configuration
-options for this package).
-
-Buildroot will automatically include the .mk files in first-level
-subdirectories of the package directory (using the pattern package/*/
-*.mk). If we want Buildroot to include .mk files from deeper
-subdirectories (like package/<company>/package1/) then we simply have
-to add a .mk file in a first-level subdirectory that includes these
-additional .mk files. Therefore, create a file package/<company>/
-<company>.mk with following contents (assuming you have only one
-extra directory level below package/<company>/):
-
-include $(sort $(wildcard package/<company>/*/*.mk))
-
-For the Config.in files, create a file package/<company>/Config.in
-that includes the Config.in files of all your packages. An exhaustive
-list has to be provided since wildcards are not supported in the
-source command of kconfig. For example:
-
-source "package/<company>/package1/Config.in"
-source "package/<company>/package2/Config.in"
-
-Include this new file package/<company>/Config.in from package/
-Config.in, preferably in a company-specific menu to make merges with
-future Buildroot versions easier.
-
-If using a br2-external tree, refer to Section9.2, Keeping
-customizations outside of Buildroot for how to fill in those files.
-
-9.10.Quick guide to storing your project-specific customizations
-
-Earlier in this chapter, the different methods for making
-project-specific customizations have been described. This section
-will now summarize all this by providing step-by-step instructions to
-storing your project-specific customizations. Clearly, the steps that
-are not relevant to your project can be skipped.
-
- 1. make menuconfig to configure toolchain, packages and kernel.
- 2. make linux-menuconfig to update the kernel config, similar for
-    other configuration like busybox, uclibc, 
- 3. mkdir -p board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>
- 4. Set the following options to board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/
-    <package>.config (as far as they are relevant):
-
-      + BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE
-      + BR2_PACKAGE_BUSYBOX_CONFIG
-      + BR2_UCLIBC_CONFIG
-      + BR2_TARGET_AT91BOOTSTRAP3_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE
-      + BR2_TARGET_BAREBOX_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE
-      + BR2_TARGET_UBOOT_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE
- 5. Write the configuration files:
-
-      + make linux-update-defconfig
-      + make busybox-update-config
-      + make uclibc-update-config
-      + cp <output>/build/at91bootstrap3-*/.config board/
-        <manufacturer>/<boardname>/at91bootstrap3.config
-      + make barebox-update-defconfig
-      + make uboot-update-defconfig
- 6. Create board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/rootfs-overlay/ and fill
-    it with additional files you need on your rootfs, e.g. board/
-    <manufacturer>/<boardname>/rootfs-overlay/etc/inittab. Set
-    BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY to board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/
-    rootfs-overlay.
- 7. Create a post-build script board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/
-    post_build.sh. Set BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT to board/
-    <manufacturer>/<boardname>/post_build.sh
- 8. If additional setuid permissions have to be set or device nodes
-    have to be created, create board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/
-    device_table.txt and add that path to BR2_ROOTFS_DEVICE_TABLE.
- 9. If additional user accounts have to be created, create board/
-    <manufacturer>/<boardname>/users_table.txt and add that path to
-    BR2_ROOTFS_USERS_TABLES.
-10. To add custom patches to certain packages, set
-    BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR to board/<manufacturer>/<boardname>/patches/
-    and add your patches for each package in a subdirectory named
-    after the package. Each patch should be called <packagename>-
-    <num>-<description>.patch.
-11. Specifically for the Linux kernel, there also exists the option
-    BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_PATCH with as main advantage that it can also
-    download patches from a URL. If you do not need this,
-    BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR is preferred. U-Boot, Barebox, at91bootstrap
-    and at91bootstrap3 also have separate options, but these do not
-    provide any advantage over BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR and will likely
-    be removed in the future.
-12. If you need to add project-specific packages, create package/
-    <manufacturer>/ and place your packages in that directory. Create
-    an overall <manufacturer>.mk file that includes the .mk files of
-    all your packages. Create an overall Config.in file that sources
-    the Config.in files of all your packages. Include this Config.in
-    file from Buildroots package/Config.in file.
-13. make savedefconfig to save the buildroot configuration.
-14. cp defconfig configs/<boardname>_defconfig
-
-Chapter10.Using SELinux in Buildroot
-
-SELinux [https://selinuxproject.org] is a Linux kernel security
-module enforcing access control policies. In addition to the
-traditional file permissions and access control lists, SELinux allows
-to write rules for users or processes to access specific functions of
-resources (files, sockets).
-
-SELinux has three modes of operation:
-
-  * Disabled: the policy is not applied
-  * Permissive: the policy is applied, and non-authorized actions are
-    simply logged. This mode is often used for troubleshooting
-    SELinux issues.
-  * Enforcing: the policy is applied, and non-authorized actions are
-    denied
-
-In Buildroot the mode of operation is controlled by the
-BR2_PACKAGE_REFPOLICY_POLICY_STATE_* configuration options. The Linux
-kernel also has various configuration options that affect how SELinux
-is enabled (see security/selinux/Kconfig in the Linux kernel
-sources).
-
-By default in Buildroot the SELinux policy is provided by the
-upstream refpolicy [https://github.com/SELinuxProject/refpolicy]
-project, enabled with BR2_PACKAGE_REFPOLICY.
-
-10.1.Enabling SELinux support
-
-To have proper support for SELinux in a Buildroot generated system,
-the following configuration options must be enabled:
-
-  * BR2_PACKAGE_LIBSELINUX
-  * BR2_PACKAGE_REFPOLICY
-
-In addition, your filesystem image format must support extended
-attributes.
-
-10.2.SELinux policy tweaking
-
-The SELinux refpolicy contains modules that can be enabled or
-disabled when being built. Each module provide a number of SELinux
-rules. In Buildroot the non-base modules are disabled by default and
-several ways to enable such modules are provided:
-
-  * Packages can enable a list of SELinux modules within the
-    refpolicy using the <packagename>_SELINUX_MODULES variable.
-  * Packages can provide additional SELinux modules by putting them
-    (.fc, .if and .te files) in package/<packagename>/selinux/.
-  * Extra SELinux modules can be added in directories pointed by the
-    BR2_REFPOLICY_EXTRA_MODULES_DIRS configuration option.
-  * Additional modules in the refpolicy can be enabled if listed in
-    the BR2_REFPOLICY_EXTRA_MODULES_DEPENDENCIES configuration
-    option.
-
-Buildroot also allows to completely override the refpolicy. This
-allows to provide a full custom policy designed specifically for a
-given system. When going this way, all of the above mechanisms are
-disabled: no extra SElinux module is added to the policy, and all the
-available modules within the custom policy are enabled and built into
-the final binary policy. The custom policy must be a fork of the
-official refpolicy [https://github.com/SELinuxProject/refpolicy].
-
-In order to fully override the refpolicy the following configuration
-variables have to be set:
-
-  * BR2_PACKAGE_REFPOLICY_CUSTOM_GIT
-  * BR2_PACKAGE_REFPOLICY_CUSTOM_REPO_URL
-  * BR2_PACKAGE_REFPOLICY_CUSTOM_REPO_VERSION
-
-Chapter11.Frequently Asked Questions & Troubleshooting
-
-11.1.The boot hangs after Starting network
-
-If the boot process seems to hang after the following messages
-(messages not necessarily exactly similar, depending on the list of
-packages selected):
-
-Freeing init memory: 3972K
-Initializing random number generator... done.
-Starting network...
-Starting dropbear sshd: generating rsa key... generating dsa key... OK
-
-then it means that your system is running, but didnt start a shell
-on the serial console. In order to have the system start a shell on
-your serial console, you have to go into the Buildroot configuration,
-in System configuration, modify Run a getty (login prompt) after boot
-and set the appropriate port and baud rate in the getty options
-submenu. This will automatically tune the /etc/inittab file of the
-generated system so that a shell starts on the correct serial port.
-
-11.2.Why is there no compiler on the target?
-
-It has been decided that support for the native compiler on the
-target would be stopped from the Buildroot-2012.11 release because:
-
-  * this feature was neither maintained nor tested, and often broken;
-  * this feature was only available for Buildroot toolchains;
-  * Buildroot mostly targets small or very small target hardware with
-    limited resource onboard (CPU, ram, mass-storage), for which
-    compiling on the target does not make much sense;
-  * Buildroot aims at easing the cross-compilation, making native
-    compilation on the target unnecessary.
-
-If you need a compiler on your target anyway, then Buildroot is not
-suitable for your purpose. In such case, you need a real distribution
-and you should opt for something like:
-
-  * openembedded [http://www.openembedded.org]
-  * yocto [https://www.yoctoproject.org]
-  * emdebian [http://www.emdebian.org]
-  * Fedora [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures]
-  * openSUSE ARM [http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM]
-  * Arch Linux ARM [http://archlinuxarm.org]
-  * 
-
-11.3.Why are there no development files on the target?
-
-Since there is no compiler available on the target (see Section11.2,
-Why is there no compiler on the target?), it does not make sense to
-waste space with headers or static libraries.
-
-Therefore, those files are always removed from the target since the
-Buildroot-2012.11 release.
-
-11.4.Why is there no documentation on the target?
-
-Because Buildroot mostly targets small or very small target hardware
-with limited resource onboard (CPU, ram, mass-storage), it does not
-make sense to waste space with the documentation data.
-
-If you need documentation data on your target anyway, then Buildroot
-is not suitable for your purpose, and you should look for a real
-distribution (see: Section11.2, Why is there no compiler on the
-target?).
-
-11.5.Why are some packages not visible in the Buildroot config menu?
-
-If a package exists in the Buildroot tree and does not appear in the
-config menu, this most likely means that some of the packages
-dependencies are not met.
-
-To know more about the dependencies of a package, search for the
-package symbol in the config menu (see Section8.1, make tips).
-
-Then, you may have to recursively enable several options (which
-correspond to the unmet dependencies) to finally be able to select
-the package.
-
-If the package is not visible due to some unmet toolchain options,
-then you should certainly run a full rebuild (see Section8.1, make
-tips for more explanations).
-
-11.6.Why not use the target directory as a chroot directory?
-
-There are plenty of reasons to not use the target directory a chroot
-one, among these:
-
-  * file ownerships, modes and permissions are not correctly set in
-    the target directory;
-  * device nodes are not created in the target directory.
-
-For these reasons, commands run through chroot, using the target
-directory as the new root, will most likely fail.
-
-If you want to run the target filesystem inside a chroot, or as an
-NFS root, then use the tarball image generated in images/ and extract
-it as root.
-
-11.7.Why doesnt Buildroot generate binary packages (.deb, .ipkg)?
-
-One feature that is often discussed on the Buildroot list is the
-general topic of "package management". To summarize, the idea would
-be to add some tracking of which Buildroot package installs what
-files, with the goals of:
-
-  * being able to remove files installed by a package when this
-    package gets unselected from the menuconfig;
-  * being able to generate binary packages (ipk or other format) that
-    can be installed on the target without re-generating a new root
-    filesystem image.
-
-In general, most people think it is easy to do: just track which
-package installed what and remove it when the package is unselected.
-However, it is much more complicated than that:
-
-  * It is not only about the target/ directory, but also the sysroot
-    in host/<tuple>/sysroot and the host/ directory itself. All files
-    installed in those directories by various packages must be
-    tracked.
-  * When a package is unselected from the configuration, it is not
-    sufficient to remove just the files it installed. One must also
-    remove all its reverse dependencies (i.e. packages relying on it)
-    and rebuild all those packages. For example, package A depends
-    optionally on the OpenSSL library. Both are selected, and
-    Buildroot is built. Package A is built with crypto support using
-    OpenSSL. Later on, OpenSSL gets unselected from the
-    configuration, but package A remains (since OpenSSL is an
-    optional dependency, this is possible.) If only OpenSSL files are
-    removed, then the files installed by package A are broken: they
-    use a library that is no longer present on the target. Although
-    this is technically doable, it adds a lot of complexity to
-    Buildroot, which goes against the simplicity we try to stick to.
-  * In addition to the previous problem, there is the case where the
-    optional dependency is not even known to Buildroot. For example,
-    package A in version 1.0 never used OpenSSL, but in version 2.0
-    it automatically uses OpenSSL if available. If the Buildroot .mk
-    file hasnt been updated to take this into account, then package
-    A will not be part of the reverse dependencies of OpenSSL and
-    will not be removed and rebuilt when OpenSSL is removed. For
-    sure, the .mk file of package A should be fixed to mention this
-    optional dependency, but in the mean time, you can have
-    non-reproducible behaviors.
-  * The request is to also allow changes in the menuconfig to be
-    applied on the output directory without having to rebuild
-    everything from scratch. However, this is very difficult to
-    achieve in a reliable way: what happens when the suboptions of a
-    package are changed (we would have to detect this, and rebuild
-    the package from scratch and potentially all its reverse
-    dependencies), what happens if toolchain options are changed,
-    etc. At the moment, what Buildroot does is clear and simple so
-    its behaviour is very reliable and it is easy to support users.
-    If configuration changes done in menuconfig are applied after the
-    next make, then it has to work correctly and properly in all
-    situations, and not have some bizarre corner cases. The risk is
-    to get bug reports like "I have enabled package A, B and C, then
-    ran make, then disabled package C and enabled package D and ran
-    make, then re-enabled package C and enabled package E and then
-    there is a build failure". Or worse "I did some configuration,
-    then built, then did some changes, built, some more changes,
-    built, some more changes, built, and now it fails, but I dont
-    remember all the changes I did and in which order". This will be
-    impossible to support.
-
-For all these reasons, the conclusion is that adding tracking of
-installed files to remove them when the package is unselected, or to
-generate a repository of binary packages, is something that is very
-hard to achieve reliably and will add a lot of complexity.
-
-On this matter, the Buildroot developers make this position
-statement:
-
-  * Buildroot strives to make it easy to generate a root filesystem
-    (hence the name, by the way.) That is what we want to make
-    Buildroot good at: building root filesystems.
-  * Buildroot is not meant to be a distribution (or rather, a
-    distribution generator.) It is the opinion of most Buildroot
-    developers that this is not a goal we should pursue. We believe
-    that there are other tools better suited to generate a distro
-    than Buildroot is. For example, Open Embedded [http://
-    openembedded.org/], or openWRT [https://openwrt.org/], are such
-    tools.
-  * We prefer to push Buildroot in a direction that makes it easy (or
-    even easier) to generate complete root filesystems. This is what
-    makes Buildroot stands out in the crowd (among other things, of
-    course!)
-  * We believe that for most embedded Linux systems, binary packages
-    are not necessary, and potentially harmful. When binary packages
-    are used, it means that the system can be partially upgraded,
-    which creates an enormous number of possible combinations of
-    package versions that should be tested before doing the upgrade
-    on the embedded device. On the other hand, by doing complete
-    system upgrades by upgrading the entire root filesystem image at
-    once, the image deployed to the embedded system is guaranteed to
-    really be the one that has been tested and validated.
-
-11.8.How to speed-up the build process?
-
-Since Buildroot often involves doing full rebuilds of the entire
-system that can be quite long, we provide below a number of tips to
-help reduce the build time:
-
-  * Use a pre-built external toolchain instead of the default
-    Buildroot internal toolchain. By using a pre-built Linaro
-    toolchain (on ARM) or a Sourcery CodeBench toolchain (for ARM,
-    x86, x86-64, MIPS, etc.), you will save the build time of the
-    toolchain at each complete rebuild, approximately 15 to 20
-    minutes. Note that temporarily using an external toolchain does
-    not prevent you to switch back to an internal toolchain (that may
-    provide a higher level of customization) once the rest of your
-    system is working;
-  * Use the ccache compiler cache (see: Section8.14.3, Using ccache
-    in Buildroot);
-  * Learn about rebuilding only the few packages you actually care
-    about (see Section8.3, Understanding how to rebuild packages),
-    but beware that sometimes full rebuilds are anyway necessary (see
-    Section8.2, Understanding when a full rebuild is necessary);
-  * Make sure you are not using a virtual machine for the Linux
-    system used to run Buildroot. Most of the virtual machine
-    technologies are known to cause a significant performance impact
-    on I/O, which is really important for building source code;
-  * Make sure that youre using only local files: do not attempt to
-    do a build over NFS, which significantly slows down the build.
-    Having the Buildroot download folder available locally also helps
-    a bit.
-  * Buy new hardware. SSDs and lots of RAM are key to speeding up the
-    builds.
-  * Experiment with top-level parallel build, see Section8.12,
-    Top-level parallel build.
-
-Chapter12.Known issues
-
-  * It is not possible to pass extra linker options via
-    BR2_TARGET_LDFLAGS if such options contain a $ sign. For example,
-    the following is known to break: BR2_TARGET_LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath=
-    '$ORIGIN/../lib'"
-  * The libffi package is not supported on the SuperH 2 and ARC
-    architectures.
-  * The prboom package triggers a compiler failure with the SuperH 4
-    compiler from Sourcery CodeBench, version 2012.09.
-
-Chapter13.Legal notice and licensing
-
-13.1.Complying with open source licenses
-
-All of the end products of Buildroot (toolchain, root filesystem,
-kernel, bootloaders) contain open source software, released under
-various licenses.
-
-Using open source software gives you the freedom to build rich
-embedded systems, choosing from a wide range of packages, but also
-imposes some obligations that you must know and honour. Some licenses
-require you to publish the license text in the documentation of your
-product. Others require you to redistribute the source code of the
-software to those that receive your product.
-
-The exact requirements of each license are documented in each
-package, and it is your responsibility (or that of your legal office)
-to comply with those requirements. To make this easier for you,
-Buildroot can collect for you some material you will probably need.
-To produce this material, after you have configured Buildroot with
-make menuconfig, make xconfig or make gconfig, run:
-
-make legal-info
-
-Buildroot will collect legally-relevant material in your output
-directory, under the legal-info/ subdirectory. There you will find:
-
-  * A README file, that summarizes the produced material and contains
-    warnings about material that Buildroot could not produce.
-  * buildroot.config: this is the Buildroot configuration file that
-    is usually produced with make menuconfig, and which is necessary
-    to reproduce the build.
-  * The source code for all packages; this is saved in the sources/
-    and host-sources/ subdirectories for target and host packages
-    respectively. The source code for packages that set <PKG>
-    _REDISTRIBUTE = NO will not be saved. Patches that were applied
-    are also saved, along with a file named series that lists the
-    patches in the order they were applied. Patches are under the
-    same license as the files that they modify. Note: Buildroot
-    applies additional patches to Libtool scripts of autotools-based
-    packages. These patches can be found under support/libtool in the
-    Buildroot source and, due to technical limitations, are not saved
-    with the package sources. You may need to collect them manually.
-  * A manifest file (one for host and one for target packages)
-    listing the configured packages, their version, license and
-    related information. Some of this information might not be
-    defined in Buildroot; such items are marked as "unknown".
-  * The license texts of all packages, in the licenses/ and
-    host-licenses/ subdirectories for target and host packages
-    respectively. If the license file(s) are not defined in
-    Buildroot, the file is not produced and a warning in the README
-    indicates this.
-
-Please note that the aim of the legal-info feature of Buildroot is to
-produce all the material that is somehow relevant for legal
-compliance with the package licenses. Buildroot does not try to
-produce the exact material that you must somehow make public.
-Certainly, more material is produced than is needed for a strict
-legal compliance. For example, it produces the source code for
-packages released under BSD-like licenses, that you are not required
-to redistribute in source form.
-
-Moreover, due to technical limitations, Buildroot does not produce
-some material that you will or may need, such as the toolchain source
-code for some of the external toolchains and the Buildroot source
-code itself. When you run make legal-info, Buildroot produces
-warnings in the README file to inform you of relevant material that
-could not be saved.
-
-Finally, keep in mind that the output of make legal-info is based on
-declarative statements in each of the packages recipes. The Buildroot
-developers try to do their best to keep those declarative statements
-as accurate as possible, to the best of their knowledge. However, it
-is very well possible that those declarative statements are not all
-fully accurate nor exhaustive. You (or your legal department) have to
-check the output of make legal-info before using it as your own
-compliance delivery. See the NO WARRANTY clauses (clauses 11 and 12)
-in the COPYING file at the root of the Buildroot distribution.
-
-13.2.Complying with the Buildroot license
-
-Buildroot itself is an open source software, released under the GNU
-General Public License, version 2 [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/
-old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html] or (at your option) any later version,
-with the exception of the package patches detailed below. However,
-being a build system, it is not normally part of the end product: if
-you develop the root filesystem, kernel, bootloader or toolchain for
-a device, the code of Buildroot is only present on the development
-machine, not in the device storage.
-
-Nevertheless, the general view of the Buildroot developers is that
-you should release the Buildroot source code along with the source
-code of other packages when releasing a product that contains
-GPL-licensed software. This is because the GNU GPL [http://
-www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html] defines the "complete
-source code" for an executable work as "all the source code for all
-modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
-plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
-executable". Buildroot is part of the scripts used to control
-compilation and installation of the executable, and as such it is
-considered part of the material that must be redistributed.
-
-Keep in mind that this is only the Buildroot developers' opinion, and
-you should consult your legal department or lawyer in case of any
-doubt.
-
-13.2.1.Patches to packages
-
-Buildroot also bundles patch files, which are applied to the sources
-of the various packages. Those patches are not covered by the license
-of Buildroot. Instead, they are covered by the license of the
-software to which the patches are applied. When said software is
-available under multiple licenses, the Buildroot patches are only
-provided under the publicly accessible licenses.
-
-See Chapter19, Patching a package for the technical details.
-
-Chapter14.Beyond Buildroot
-
-14.1.Boot the generated images
-
-14.1.1.NFS boot
-
-To achieve NFS-boot, enable tar root filesystem in the Filesystem
-images menu.
-
-After a complete build, just run the following commands to setup the
-NFS-root directory:
-
-sudo tar -xavf /path/to/output_dir/rootfs.tar -C /path/to/nfs_root_dir
-
-Remember to add this path to /etc/exports.
-
-Then, you can execute a NFS-boot from your target.
-
-14.1.2.Live CD
-
-To build a live CD image, enable the iso image option in the 
-Filesystem images menu. Note that this option is only available on
-the x86 and x86-64 architectures, and if you are building your kernel
-with Buildroot.
-
-You can build a live CD image with either IsoLinux, Grub or Grub 2 as
-a bootloader, but only Isolinux supports making this image usable
-both as a live CD and live USB (through the Build hybrid image
-option).
-
-You can test your live CD image using QEMU:
-
-qemu-system-i386 -cdrom output/images/rootfs.iso9660
-
-Or use it as a hard-drive image if it is a hybrid ISO:
-
-qemu-system-i386 -hda output/images/rootfs.iso9660
-
-It can be easily flashed to a USB drive with dd:
-
-dd if=output/images/rootfs.iso9660 of=/dev/sdb
-
-14.2.Chroot
-
-If you want to chroot in a generated image, then there are few thing
-you should be aware of:
-
-  * you should setup the new root from the tar root filesystem image;
-  * either the selected target architecture is compatible with your
-    host machine, or you should use some qemu-* binary and correctly
-    set it within the binfmt properties to be able to run the
-    binaries built for the target on your host machine;
-  * Buildroot does not currently provide host-qemu and binfmt
-    correctly built and set for that kind of use.

-Chapter15.How Buildroot works
-
-As mentioned above, Buildroot is basically a set of Makefiles that
-download, configure, and compile software with the correct options.
-It also includes patches for various software packages - mainly the
-ones involved in the cross-compilation toolchain (gcc, binutils and
-uClibc).
-
-There is basically one Makefile per software package, and they are
-named with the .mk extension. Makefiles are split into many different
-parts.
-
-  * The toolchain/ directory contains the Makefiles and associated
-    files for all software related to the cross-compilation
-    toolchain: binutils, gcc, gdb, kernel-headers and uClibc.
-  * The arch/ directory contains the definitions for all the
-    processor architectures that are supported by Buildroot.
-  * The package/ directory contains the Makefiles and associated
-    files for all user-space tools and libraries that Buildroot can
-    compile and add to the target root filesystem. There is one
-    sub-directory per package.
-  * The linux/ directory contains the Makefiles and associated files
-    for the Linux kernel.
-  * The boot/ directory contains the Makefiles and associated files
-    for the bootloaders supported by Buildroot.
-  * The system/ directory contains support for system integration,
-    e.g. the target filesystem skeleton and the selection of an init
-    system.
-  * The fs/ directory contains the Makefiles and associated files for
-    software related to the generation of the target root filesystem
-    image.
-
-Each directory contains at least 2 files:
-
-  * something.mk is the Makefile that downloads, configures, compiles
-    and installs the package something.
-  * Config.in is a part of the configuration tool description file.
-    It describes the options related to the package.
-
-The main Makefile performs the following steps (once the
-configuration is done):
-
-  * Create all the output directories: staging, target, build, etc.
-    in the output directory (output/ by default, another value can be
-    specified using O=)
-  * Generate the toolchain target. When an internal toolchain is
-    used, this means generating the cross-compilation toolchain. When
-    an external toolchain is used, this means checking the features
-    of the external toolchain and importing it into the Buildroot
-    environment.
-  * Generate all the targets listed in the TARGETS variable. This
-    variable is filled by all the individual components' Makefiles.
-    Generating these targets will trigger the compilation of the
-    userspace packages (libraries, programs), the kernel, the
-    bootloader and the generation of the root filesystem images,
-    depending on the configuration.
-
-Chapter16.Coding style
-
-Overall, these coding style rules are here to help you to add new
-files in Buildroot or refactor existing ones.
-
-If you slightly modify some existing file, the important thing is to
-keep the consistency of the whole file, so you can:
-
-  * either follow the potentially deprecated coding style used in
-    this file,
-  * or entirely rework it in order to make it comply with these
-    rules.
-
-16.1.Config.in file
-
-Config.in files contain entries for almost anything configurable in
-Buildroot.
-
-An entry has the following pattern:
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_LIBFOO
-        bool "libfoo"
-        depends on BR2_PACKAGE_LIBBAZ
-        select BR2_PACKAGE_LIBBAR
-        help
-          This is a comment that explains what libfoo is. The help text
-          should be wrapped.
-
-          http://foosoftware.org/libfoo/
-
-  * The bool, depends on, select and help lines are indented with one
-    tab.
-  * The help text itself should be indented with one tab and two
-    spaces.
-  * The help text should be wrapped to fit 72 columns, where tab
-    counts for 8, so 62 characters in the text itself.
-
-The Config.in files are the input for the configuration tool used in
-Buildroot, which is the regular Kconfig. For further details about
-the Kconfig language, refer to http://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/
-kbuild/kconfig-language.txt.
-
-16.2.The .mk file
-
-  * Header: The file starts with a header. It contains the module
-    name, preferably in lowercase, enclosed between separators made
-    of 80 hashes. A blank line is mandatory after the header:
-
-    ################################################################################
-    #
-    # libfoo
-    #
-    ################################################################################
-
-  * Assignment: use = preceded and followed by one space:
-
-    LIBFOO_VERSION = 1.0
-    LIBFOO_CONF_OPTS += --without-python-support
-
-    Do not align the = signs.
-
-  * Indentation: use tab only:
-
-    define LIBFOO_REMOVE_DOC
-            $(RM) -fr $(TARGET_DIR)/usr/share/libfoo/doc \
-                    $(TARGET_DIR)/usr/share/man/man3/libfoo*
-    endef
-
-    Note that commands inside a define block should always start with
-    a tab, so make recognizes them as commands.
-
-  * Optional dependency:
-
-      + Prefer multi-line syntax.
-
-        YES:
-
-        ifeq ($(BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON),y)
-        LIBFOO_CONF_OPTS += --with-python-support
-        LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES += python
-        else
-        LIBFOO_CONF_OPTS += --without-python-support
-        endif
-
-        NO:
-
-        LIBFOO_CONF_OPTS += --with$(if $(BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON),,out)-python-support
-        LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES += $(if $(BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON),python,)
-
-      + Keep configure options and dependencies close together.
-  * Optional hooks: keep hook definition and assignment together in
-    one if block.
-
-    YES:
-
-    ifneq ($(BR2_LIBFOO_INSTALL_DATA),y)
-    define LIBFOO_REMOVE_DATA
-            $(RM) -fr $(TARGET_DIR)/usr/share/libfoo/data
-    endef
-    LIBFOO_POST_INSTALL_TARGET_HOOKS += LIBFOO_REMOVE_DATA
-    endif
-
-    NO:
-
-    define LIBFOO_REMOVE_DATA
-            $(RM) -fr $(TARGET_DIR)/usr/share/libfoo/data
-    endef
-
-    ifneq ($(BR2_LIBFOO_INSTALL_DATA),y)
-    LIBFOO_POST_INSTALL_TARGET_HOOKS += LIBFOO_REMOVE_DATA
-    endif
-
-16.3.The documentation
-
-The documentation uses the asciidoc [http://www.methods.co.nz/
-asciidoc/] format.
-
-For further details about the asciidoc syntax, refer to http://
-www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html.
-
-16.4.Support scripts
-
-Some scripts in the support/ and utils/ directories are written in
-Python and should follow the PEP8 Style Guide for Python Code [https:
-//www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/].
-
-Chapter17.Adding support for a particular board
-
-Buildroot contains basic configurations for several publicly
-available hardware boards, so that users of such a board can easily
-build a system that is known to work. You are welcome to add support
-for other boards to Buildroot too.
-
-To do so, you need to create a normal Buildroot configuration that
-builds a basic system for the hardware: (internal) toolchain, kernel,
-bootloader, filesystem and a simple BusyBox-only userspace. No
-specific package should be selected: the configuration should be as
-minimal as possible, and should only build a working basic BusyBox
-system for the target platform. You can of course use more
-complicated configurations for your internal projects, but the
-Buildroot project will only integrate basic board configurations.
-This is because package selections are highly application-specific.
-
-Once you have a known working configuration, run make savedefconfig.
-This will generate a minimal defconfig file at the root of the
-Buildroot source tree. Move this file into the configs/ directory,
-and rename it <boardname>_defconfig. If the configuration is a bit
-more complicated, it is nice to manually reformat it and separate it
-into sections, with a comment before each section. Typical sections
-are Architecture, Toolchain options (typically just linux headers
-version), Firmware, Bootloader, Kernel, and Filesystem.
-
-Always use fixed versions or commit hashes for the different
-components, not the "latest" version. For example, set
-BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_VERSION=y and
-BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_VERSION_VALUE to the kernel version you
-tested with.
-
-It is recommended to use as much as possible upstream versions of the
-Linux kernel and bootloaders, and to use as much as possible default
-kernel and bootloader configurations. If they are incorrect for your
-board, or no default exists, we encourage you to send fixes to the
-corresponding upstream projects.
-
-However, in the mean time, you may want to store kernel or bootloader
-configuration or patches specific to your target platform. To do so,
-create a directory board/<manufacturer> and a subdirectory board/
-<manufacturer>/<boardname>. You can then store your patches and
-configurations in these directories, and reference them from the main
-Buildroot configuration. Refer to Chapter9, Project-specific
-customization for more details.
-
-Chapter18.Adding new packages to Buildroot
-
-This section covers how new packages (userspace libraries or
-applications) can be integrated into Buildroot. It also shows how
-existing packages are integrated, which is needed for fixing issues
-or tuning their configuration.
-
-When you add a new package, be sure to test it in various conditions
-(see Section18.24.3, How to test your package) and also check it
-for coding style (see Section18.24.2, How to check the coding
-style).
-
-18.1.Package directory
-
-First of all, create a directory under the package directory for your
-software, for example libfoo.
-
-Some packages have been grouped by topic in a sub-directory: x11r7,
-qt5 and gstreamer. If your package fits in one of these categories,
-then create your package directory in these. New subdirectories are
-discouraged, however.
-
-18.2.Config files
-
-For the package to be displayed in the configuration tool, you need
-to create a Config file in your package directory. There are two
-types: Config.in and Config.in.host.
-
-18.2.1.Config.in file
-
-For packages used on the target, create a file named Config.in. This
-file will contain the option descriptions related to our libfoo
-software that will be used and displayed in the configuration tool.
-It should basically contain:
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_LIBFOO
-        bool "libfoo"
-        help
-          This is a comment that explains what libfoo is. The help text
-          should be wrapped.
-
-          http://foosoftware.org/libfoo/
-
-The bool line, help line and other metadata information about the
-configuration option must be indented with one tab. The help text
-itself should be indented with one tab and two spaces, lines should
-be wrapped to fit 72 columns, where tab counts for 8, so 62
-characters in the text itself. The help text must mention the
-upstream URL of the project after an empty line.
-
-As a convention specific to Buildroot, the ordering of the attributes
-is as follows:
-
- 1. The type of option: bool, string with the prompt
- 2. If needed, the default value(s)
- 3. Any dependencies on the target in depends on form
- 4. Any dependencies on the toolchain in depends on form
- 5. Any dependencies on other packages in depends on form
- 6. Any dependency of the select form
- 7. The help keyword and help text.
-
-You can add other sub-options into a if BR2_PACKAGE_LIBFOOendif
-statement to configure particular things in your software. You can
-look at examples in other packages. The syntax of the Config.in file
-is the same as the one for the kernel Kconfig file. The documentation
-for this syntax is available at http://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/
-kbuild/kconfig-language.txt
-
-Finally you have to add your new libfoo/Config.in to package/
-Config.in (or in a category subdirectory if you decided to put your
-package in one of the existing categories). The files included there
-are sorted alphabetically per category and are NOT supposed to
-contain anything but the bare name of the package.
-
-source "package/libfoo/Config.in"
-
-18.2.2.Config.in.host file
-
-Some packages also need to be built for the host system. There are
-two options here:
-
-  * The host package is only required to satisfy build-time
-    dependencies of one or more target packages. In this case, add
-    host-foo to the target packages BAR_DEPENDENCIES variable. No
-    Config.in.host file should be created.
-  * The host package should be explicitly selectable by the user from
-    the configuration menu. In this case, create a Config.in.host
-    file for that host package:
-
-    config BR2_PACKAGE_HOST_FOO
-            bool "host foo"
-            help
-              This is a comment that explains what foo for the host is.
-
-              http://foosoftware.org/foo/
-
-    The same coding style and options as for the Config.in file are
-    valid.
-
-    Finally you have to add your new libfoo/Config.in.host to package
-    /Config.in.host. The files included there are sorted
-    alphabetically and are NOT supposed to contain anything but the 
-    bare name of the package.
-
-    source "package/foo/Config.in.host"
-
-    The host package will then be available from the Host utilities
-    menu.
-
-18.2.3.Choosing depends on or select
-
-The Config.in file of your package must also ensure that dependencies
-are enabled. Typically, Buildroot uses the following rules:
-
-  * Use a select type of dependency for dependencies on libraries.
-    These dependencies are generally not obvious and it therefore
-    make sense to have the kconfig system ensure that the
-    dependencies are selected. For example, the libgtk2 package uses
-    select BR2_PACKAGE_LIBGLIB2 to make sure this library is also
-    enabled. The select keyword expresses the dependency with a
-    backward semantic.
-  * Use a depends on type of dependency when the user really needs to
-    be aware of the dependency. Typically, Buildroot uses this type
-    of dependency for dependencies on target architecture, MMU
-    support and toolchain options (see Section18.2.4, Dependencies
-    on target and toolchain options), or for dependencies on "big"
-    things, such as the X.org system. The depends on keyword
-    expresses the dependency with a forward semantic.
-
-Note.The current problem with the kconfig language is that these two
-dependency semantics are not internally linked. Therefore, it may be
-possible to select a package, whom one of its dependencies/
-requirement is not met.
-
-An example illustrates both the usage of select and depends on.
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_RRDTOOL
-        bool "rrdtool"
-        depends on BR2_USE_WCHAR
-        select BR2_PACKAGE_FREETYPE
-        select BR2_PACKAGE_LIBART
-        select BR2_PACKAGE_LIBPNG
-        select BR2_PACKAGE_ZLIB
-        help
-          RRDtool is the OpenSource industry standard, high performance
-          data logging and graphing system for time series data.
-
-          http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/
-
-comment "rrdtool needs a toolchain w/ wchar"
-        depends on !BR2_USE_WCHAR
-
-Note that these two dependency types are only transitive with the
-dependencies of the same kind.
-
-This means, in the following example:
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_A
-        bool "Package A"
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_B
-        bool "Package B"
-        depends on BR2_PACKAGE_A
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_C
-        bool "Package C"
-        depends on BR2_PACKAGE_B
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_D
-        bool "Package D"
-        select BR2_PACKAGE_B
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_E
-        bool "Package E"
-        select BR2_PACKAGE_D
-
-  * Selecting Package C will be visible if Package B has been
-    selected, which in turn is only visible if Package A has been
-    selected.
-  * Selecting Package E will select Package D, which will select
-    Package B, it will not check for the dependencies of Package B,
-    so it will not select Package A.
-  * Since Package B is selected but Package A is not, this violates
-    the dependency of Package B on Package A. Therefore, in such a
-    situation, the transitive dependency has to be added explicitly:
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_D
-        bool "Package D"
-        select BR2_PACKAGE_B
-        depends on BR2_PACKAGE_A
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_E
-        bool "Package E"
-        select BR2_PACKAGE_D
-        depends on BR2_PACKAGE_A
-
-Overall, for package library dependencies, select should be
-preferred.
-
-Note that such dependencies will ensure that the dependency option is
-also enabled, but not necessarily built before your package. To do
-so, the dependency also needs to be expressed in the .mk file of the
-package.
-
-Further formatting details: see the coding style.
-
-18.2.4.Dependencies on target and toolchain options
-
-Many packages depend on certain options of the toolchain: the choice
-of C library, C++ support, thread support, RPC support, wchar
-support, or dynamic library support. Some packages can only be built
-on certain target architectures, or if an MMU is available in the
-processor.
-
-These dependencies have to be expressed with the appropriate depends
-on statements in the Config.in file. Additionally, for dependencies
-on toolchain options, a comment should be displayed when the option
-is not enabled, so that the user knows why the package is not
-available. Dependencies on target architecture or MMU support should
-not be made visible in a comment: since it is unlikely that the user
-can freely choose another target, it makes little sense to show these
-dependencies explicitly.
-
-The comment should only be visible if the config option itself would
-be visible when the toolchain option dependencies are met. This means
-that all other dependencies of the package (including dependencies on
-target architecture and MMU support) have to be repeated on the
-comment definition. To keep it clear, the depends on statement for
-these non-toolchain option should be kept separate from the depends
-on statement for the toolchain options. If there is a dependency on a
-config option in that same file (typically the main package) it is
-preferable to have a global if  endif construct rather than
-repeating the depends on statement on the comment and other config
-options.
-
-The general format of a dependency comment for package foo is:
-
-foo needs a toolchain w/ featA, featB, featC
-
-for example:
-
-mpd needs a toolchain w/ C++, threads, wchar
-
-or
-
-crda needs a toolchain w/ threads
-
-Note that this text is kept brief on purpose, so that it will fit on
-a 80-character terminal.
-
-The rest of this section enumerates the different target and
-toolchain options, the corresponding config symbols to depend on, and
-the text to use in the comment.
-
-  * Target architecture
-
-      + Dependency symbol: BR2_powerpc, BR2_mips,  (see arch/

-  * MMU support
-
-      + Dependency symbol: BR2_USE_MMU

-  * Gcc _sync* built-ins used for atomic operations. They are
-    available in variants operating on 1 byte, 2 bytes, 4 bytes and 8

-    size:
-
-      + Dependency symbol: BR2_TOOLCHAIN_HAS_SYNC_1 for 1 byte,
-        BR2_TOOLCHAIN_HAS_SYNC_2 for 2 bytes,

-18.2.5.Dependencies on a Linux kernel built by buildroot
-
-Some packages need a Linux kernel to be built by buildroot. These are
-typically kernel modules or firmware. A comment should be added in
-the Config.in file to express this dependency, similar to
-dependencies on toolchain options. The general format is:
-
-foo needs a Linux kernel to be built
-
-If there is a dependency on both toolchain options and the Linux
-kernel, use this format:
-
-foo needs a toolchain w/ featA, featB, featC and a Linux kernel to be built
-
-18.2.6.Dependencies on udev /dev management
-
-If a package needs udev /dev management, it should depend on symbol
-BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_UDEV, and the following comment should be added:
-
-foo needs udev /dev management
-
-If there is a dependency on both toolchain options and udev /dev
-management, use this format:
-
-foo needs udev /dev management and a toolchain w/ featA, featB, featC
-
-18.2.7.Dependencies on features provided by virtual packages
-
-Some features can be provided by more than one package, such as the
-openGL libraries.
-
-See Section18.11, Infrastructure for virtual packages for more on
-the virtual packages.
-
-18.3.The .mk file
-
-Finally, heres the hardest part. Create a file named libfoo.mk. It
-describes how the package should be downloaded, configured, built,
-installed, etc.
-
-Depending on the package type, the .mk file must be written in a
-different way, using different infrastructures:
-
-  * Makefiles for generic packages (not using autotools or CMake):
-    These are based on an infrastructure similar to the one used for
-    autotools-based packages, but require a little more work from the
-    developer. They specify what should be done for the
-    configuration, compilation and installation of the package. This
-    infrastructure must be used for all packages that do not use the
-    autotools as their build system. In the future, other specialized
-    infrastructures might be written for other build systems. We
-    cover them through in a tutorial and a reference.
-  * Makefiles for autotools-based software (autoconf, automake,
-    etc.): We provide a dedicated infrastructure for such packages,
-    since autotools is a very common build system. This
-    infrastructure must be used for new packages that rely on the
-    autotools as their build system. We cover them through a tutorial
-    and reference.
-  * Makefiles for cmake-based software: We provide a dedicated
-    infrastructure for such packages, as CMake is a more and more
-    commonly used build system and has a standardized behaviour. This
-    infrastructure must be used for new packages that rely on CMake.
-    We cover them through a tutorial and reference.
-  * Makefiles for Python modules: We have a dedicated infrastructure
-    for Python modules that use either the distutils or the
-    setuptools mechanism. We cover them through a tutorial and a
-    reference.
-  * Makefiles for Lua modules: We have a dedicated infrastructure for
-    Lua modules available through the LuaRocks web site. We cover
-    them through a tutorial and a reference.
-
-Further formatting details: see the writing rules.
-
-18.4.The .hash file
-
-When possible, you must add a third file, named libfoo.hash, that
-contains the hashes of the downloaded files for the libfoo package.
-The only reason for not adding a .hash file is when hash checking is
-not possible due to how the package is downloaded.
-
-When a package has a version selection choice, then the hash file may
-be stored in a subdirectory named after the version, e.g. package/
-libfoo/1.2.3/libfoo.hash. This is especially important if the
-different versions have different licensing terms, but they are
-stored in the same file. Otherwise, the hash file should stay in the
-packages directory.
-
-The hashes stored in that file are used to validate the integrity of
-the downloaded files and of the license files.
-
-The format of this file is one line for each file for which to check
-the hash, each line with the following three fields separated by two
-spaces:
-
-  * the type of hash, one of:
-
-      + md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512, none
-  * the hash of the file:
-
-      + for none, one or more non-space chars, usually just the
-        string xxx
-      + for md5, 32 hexadecimal characters
-      + for sha1, 40 hexadecimal characters
-      + for sha224, 56 hexadecimal characters
-      + for sha256, 64 hexadecimal characters
-      + for sha384, 96 hexadecimal characters
-      + for sha512, 128 hexadecimal characters
-  * the name of the file:
-
-      + for a source archive: the basename of the file, without any
-        directory component,
-      + for a license file: the path as it appears in
-        FOO_LICENSE_FILES.
-
-Lines starting with a # sign are considered comments, and ignored.
-Empty lines are ignored.
-
-There can be more than one hash for a single file, each on its own
-line. In this case, all hashes must match.
-
-Note.Ideally, the hashes stored in this file should match the hashes
-published by upstream, e.g. on their website, in the e-mail
-announcement If upstream provides more than one type of hash (e.g.
-sha1 and sha512), then it is best to add all those hashes in the
-.hash file. If upstream does not provide any hash, or only provides
-an md5 hash, then compute at least one strong hash yourself
-(preferably sha256, but not md5), and mention this in a comment line
-above the hashes.
-
-Note.The hashes for license files are used to detect a license
-change when a package version is bumped. The hashes are checked
-during the make legal-info target run. For a package with multiple
-versions (like Qt5), create the hash file in a subdirectory
-<packageversion> of that package (see also Section19.2, How patches
-are applied).
-
-The none hash type is reserved to those archives downloaded from a
-repository, like a git clone, a subversion checkout
-
-The example below defines a sha1 and a sha256 published by upstream
-for the main libfoo-1.2.3.tar.bz2 tarball, an md5 from upstream and a
-locally-computed sha256 hashes for a binary blob, a sha256 for a
-downloaded patch, and an archive with no hash:
-
-# Hashes from: http://www.foosoftware.org/download/libfoo-1.2.3.tar.bz2.{sha1,sha256}:
-sha1  486fb55c3efa71148fe07895fd713ea3a5ae343a  libfoo-1.2.3.tar.bz2

-
-# md5 from: http://www.foosoftware.org/download/libfoo-1.2.3.tar.bz2.md5, sha256 locally computed:
-md5  2d608f3c318c6b7557d551a5a09314f03452f1a1  libfoo-data.bin

-

-
-# Hash for license files:
-sha256  a45a845012742796534f7e91fe623262ccfb99460a2bd04015bd28d66fba95b8  COPYING

-
-If the .hash file is present, and it contains one or more hashes for
-a downloaded file, the hash(es) computed by Buildroot (after
-download) must match the hash(es) stored in the .hash file. If one or
-more hashes do not match, Buildroot considers this an error, deletes
-the downloaded file, and aborts.
-
-If the .hash file is present, but it does not contain a hash for a
-downloaded file, Buildroot considers this an error and aborts.
-However, the downloaded file is left in the download directory since
-this typically indicates that the .hash file is wrong but the
-downloaded file is probably OK.
-
-Hashes are currently checked for files fetched from http/ftp servers,
-Git repositories, files copied using scp and local files. Hashes are
-not checked for other version control systems (such as Subversion,
-CVS, etc.) because Buildroot currently does not generate reproducible
-tarballs when source code is fetched from such version control
-systems.
-
-Hashes should only be added in .hash files for files that are
-guaranteed to be stable. For example, patches auto-generated by
-Github are not guaranteed to be stable, and therefore their hashes
-can change over time. Such patches should not be downloaded, and
-instead be added locally to the package folder.
-
-If the .hash file is missing, then no check is done at all.
-
-18.5.Infrastructure for packages with specific build systems
-
-By packages with specific build systems we mean all the packages
-whose build system is not one of the standard ones, such as autotools
-or CMake. This typically includes packages whose build system is
-based on hand-written Makefiles or shell scripts.

-
-The Makefile begins on line 7 to 11 with metadata information: the
-version of the package (LIBFOO_VERSION), the name of the tarball
-containing the package (LIBFOO_SOURCE) (xz-ed tarball recommended)
-the Internet location at which the tarball can be downloaded from
-(LIBFOO_SITE), the license (LIBFOO_LICENSE) and file with the license
-text (LIBFOO_LICENSE_FILES). All variables must start with the same
-prefix, LIBFOO_ in this case. This prefix is always the uppercased
-version of the package name (see below to understand where the
-package name is defined).
-
-On line 12, we specify that this package wants to install something
-to the staging space. This is often needed for libraries, since they
-must install header files and other development files in the staging
-space. This will ensure that the commands listed in the
-LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS variable will be executed.
-
-On line 13, we specify that there is some fixing to be done to some
-of the libfoo-config files that were installed during
-LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS phase. These *-config files are
-executable shell script files that are located in $(STAGING_DIR)/usr/
-bin directory and are executed by other 3rd party packages to find
-out the location and the linking flags of this particular package.
-
-The problem is that all these *-config files by default give wrong,
-host system linking flags that are unsuitable for cross-compiling.
-
-For example: -I/usr/include instead of -I$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/include
-or: -L/usr/lib instead of -L$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/lib
-
-So some sed magic is done to these scripts to make them give correct
-flags. The argument to be given to LIBFOO_CONFIG_SCRIPTS is the file
-name(s) of the shell script(s) needing fixing. All these names are
-relative to $(STAGING_DIR)/usr/bin and if needed multiple names can
-be given.
-
-In addition, the scripts listed in LIBFOO_CONFIG_SCRIPTS are removed
-from $(TARGET_DIR)/usr/bin, since they are not needed on the target.
-
-Example18.1.Config script: divine package
-
-Package divine installs shell script $(STAGING_DIR)/usr/bin/
-divine-config.
-
-So its fixup would be:
-
-DIVINE_CONFIG_SCRIPTS = divine-config
-
-
-Example18.2.Config script: imagemagick package:
-
-Package imagemagick installs the following scripts: $(STAGING_DIR)/
-usr/bin/{Magick,Magick++,MagickCore,MagickWand,Wand}-config
-
-So its fixup would be:
-
-IMAGEMAGICK_CONFIG_SCRIPTS = \
-   Magick-config Magick++-config \
-   MagickCore-config MagickWand-config Wand-config
-
-
-On line 14, we specify the list of dependencies this package relies
-on. These dependencies are listed in terms of lower-case package
-names, which can be packages for the target (without the host-
-prefix) or packages for the host (with the host-) prefix). Buildroot
-will ensure that all these packages are built and installed before
-the current package starts its configuration.
-
-The rest of the Makefile, lines 16..29, defines what should be done
-at the different steps of the package configuration, compilation and
-installation. LIBFOO_BUILD_CMDS tells what steps should be performed
-to build the package. LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS tells what steps
-should be performed to install the package in the staging space.
-LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET_CMDS tells what steps should be performed to
-install the package in the target space.
-
-All these steps rely on the $(@D) variable, which contains the
-directory where the source code of the package has been extracted.
-
-On lines 31..33, we define a user that is used by this package (e.g.
-to run a daemon as non-root) (LIBFOO_USERS).
-
-On line 35..37, we define a device-node file used by this package
-(LIBFOO_DEVICES).
-
-On line 39..41, we define the permissions to set to specific files
-installed by this package (LIBFOO_PERMISSIONS).
-
-Finally, on line 43, we call the generic-package function, which
-generates, according to the variables defined previously, all the
-Makefile code necessary to make your package working.
-
-18.5.2.generic-package reference
-
-There are two variants of the generic target. The generic-package
-macro is used for packages to be cross-compiled for the target. The
-host-generic-package macro is used for host packages, natively
-compiled for the host. It is possible to call both of them in a
-single .mk file: once to create the rules to generate a target
-package and once to create the rules to generate a host package:
-
-$(eval $(generic-package))
-$(eval $(host-generic-package))
-
-This might be useful if the compilation of the target package
-requires some tools to be installed on the host. If the package name
-is libfoo, then the name of the package for the target is also
-libfoo, while the name of the package for the host is host-libfoo.
-These names should be used in the DEPENDENCIES variables of other
-packages, if they depend on libfoo or host-libfoo.
-
-The call to the generic-package and/or host-generic-package macro 
-must be at the end of the .mk file, after all variable definitions.
-The call to host-generic-package must be after the call to
-generic-package, if any.
-
-For the target package, the generic-package uses the variables
-defined by the .mk file and prefixed by the uppercased package name:
-LIBFOO_*. host-generic-package uses the HOST_LIBFOO_* variables. For 
-some variables, if the HOST_LIBFOO_ prefixed variable doesnt exist,
-the package infrastructure uses the corresponding variable prefixed
-by LIBFOO_. This is done for variables that are likely to have the
-same value for both the target and host packages. See below for
-details.
-
-The list of variables that can be set in a .mk file to give metadata
-information is (assuming the package name is libfoo) :
-
-  * LIBFOO_VERSION, mandatory, must contain the version of the
-    package. Note that if HOST_LIBFOO_VERSION doesnt exist, it is
-    assumed to be the same as LIBFOO_VERSION. It can also be a
-    revision number or a tag for packages that are fetched directly
-    from their version control system. Examples:
-
-      + a version for a release tarball: LIBFOO_VERSION = 0.1.2
-      + a sha1 for a git tree: LIBFOO_VERSION =
-        cb9d6aa9429e838f0e54faa3d455bcbab5eef057
-      + a tag for a git tree LIBFOO_VERSION = v0.1.2
-
-        Note:Using a branch name as FOO_VERSION is not supported,
-        because it does not and can not work as people would expect
-        it should:
-
-         1. due to local caching, Buildroot will not re-fetch the
-            repository, so people who expect to be able to follow the
-            remote repository would be quite surprised and
-            disappointed;
-         2. because two builds can never be perfectly simultaneous,
-            and because the remote repository may get new commits on
-            the branch anytime, two users, using the same Buildroot
-            tree and building the same configuration, may get
-            different source, thus rendering the build non
-            reproducible, and people would be quite surprised and
-            disappointed.
-  * LIBFOO_SOURCE may contain the name of the tarball of the package,
-    which Buildroot will use to download the tarball from
-    LIBFOO_SITE. If HOST_LIBFOO_SOURCE is not specified, it defaults
-    to LIBFOO_SOURCE. If none are specified, then the value is
-    assumed to be libfoo-$(LIBFOO_VERSION).tar.gz. Example:
-    LIBFOO_SOURCE = foobar-$(LIBFOO_VERSION).tar.bz2
-  * LIBFOO_PATCH may contain a space-separated list of patch file
-    names, that Buildroot will download and apply to the package
-    source code. If an entry contains ://, then Buildroot will assume
-    it is a full URL and download the patch from this location.
-    Otherwise, Buildroot will assume that the patch should be
-    downloaded from LIBFOO_SITE. If HOST_LIBFOO_PATCH is not
-    specified, it defaults to LIBFOO_PATCH. Note that patches that
-    are included in Buildroot itself use a different mechanism: all
-    files of the form *.patch present in the package directory inside
-    Buildroot will be applied to the package after extraction (see
-    patching a package). Finally, patches listed in the LIBFOO_PATCH
-    variable are applied before the patches stored in the Buildroot
-    package directory.
-  * LIBFOO_SITE provides the location of the package, which can be a
-    URL or a local filesystem path. HTTP, FTP and SCP are supported
-    URL types for retrieving package tarballs. In these cases dont
-    include a trailing slash: it will be added by Buildroot between
-    the directory and the filename as appropriate. Git, Subversion,
-    Mercurial, and Bazaar are supported URL types for retrieving
-    packages directly from source code management systems. There is a
-    helper function to make it easier to download source tarballs
-    from GitHub (refer to Section18.24.4, How to add a package from
-    GitHub for details). A filesystem path may be used to specify
-    either a tarball or a directory containing the package source
-    code. See LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD below for more details on how
-    retrieval works. Note that SCP URLs should be of the form scp://
-    [user@]host:filepath, and that filepath is relative to the users
-    home directory, so you may want to prepend the path with a slash
-    for absolute paths: scp://[user@]host:/absolutepath. If
-    HOST_LIBFOO_SITE is not specified, it defaults to LIBFOO_SITE.
-    Examples: LIBFOO_SITE=http://www.libfoosoftware.org/libfoo
-    LIBFOO_SITE=http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/Tremor LIBFOO_SITE=/opt/
-    software/libfoo.tar.gz LIBFOO_SITE=$(TOPDIR)/../src/libfoo
-  * LIBFOO_DL_OPTS is a space-separated list of additional options to
-    pass to the downloader. Useful for retrieving documents with
-    server-side checking for user logins and passwords, or to use a
-    proxy. All download methods valid for LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD are
-    supported; valid options depend on the download method (consult
-    the man page for the respective download utilities).
-  * LIBFOO_EXTRA_DOWNLOADS is a space-separated list of additional
-    files that Buildroot should download. If an entry contains ://
-    then Buildroot will assume it is a complete URL and will download
-    the file using this URL. Otherwise, Buildroot will assume the
-    file to be downloaded is located at LIBFOO_SITE. Buildroot will
-    not do anything with those additional files, except download
-    them: it will be up to the package recipe to use them from $
-    (LIBFOO_DL_DIR).
-  * LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD determines the method used to fetch or copy
-    the package source code. In many cases, Buildroot guesses the
-    method from the contents of LIBFOO_SITE and setting
-    LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD is unnecessary. When HOST_LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD
-    is not specified, it defaults to the value of LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD.
-    The possible values of LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD are:
-
-      + wget for normal FTP/HTTP downloads of tarballs. Used by
-        default when LIBFOO_SITE begins with http://, https:// or
-        ftp://.
-      + scp for downloads of tarballs over SSH with scp. Used by
-        default when LIBFOO_SITE begins with scp://.
-      + svn for retrieving source code from a Subversion repository.
-        Used by default when LIBFOO_SITE begins with svn://. When a
-        http:// Subversion repository URL is specified in
-        LIBFOO_SITE, one must specify LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD=svn.
-        Buildroot performs a checkout which is preserved as a tarball
-        in the download cache; subsequent builds use the tarball
-        instead of performing another checkout.
-      + cvs for retrieving source code from a CVS repository. Used by
-        default when LIBFOO_SITE begins with cvs://. The downloaded
-        source code is cached as with the svn method. Anonymous
-        pserver mode is assumed otherwise explicitly defined on
-        LIBFOO_SITE. Both LIBFOO_SITE=cvs://libfoo.net:/cvsroot/
-        libfoo and LIBFOO_SITE=cvs://:ext:libfoo.net:/cvsroot/libfoo
-        are accepted, on the former anonymous pserver access mode is
-        assumed. LIBFOO_SITE must contain the source URL as well as
-        the remote repository directory. The module is the package
-        name. LIBFOO_VERSION is mandatory and must be a tag, a
-        branch, or a date (e.g. "2014-10-20", "2014-10-20 13:45",
-        "2014-10-20 13:45+01" see "man cvs" for further details).
-      + git for retrieving source code from a Git repository. Used by
-        default when LIBFOO_SITE begins with git://. The downloaded
-        source code is cached as with the svn method.
-      + hg for retrieving source code from a Mercurial repository.
-        One must specify LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD=hg when LIBFOO_SITE
-        contains a Mercurial repository URL. The downloaded source
-        code is cached as with the svn method.
-      + bzr for retrieving source code from a Bazaar repository. Used
-        by default when LIBFOO_SITE begins with bzr://. The
-        downloaded source code is cached as with the svn method.
-      + file for a local tarball. One should use this when
-        LIBFOO_SITE specifies a package tarball as a local filename.
-        Useful for software that isnt available publicly or in
-        version control.
-      + local for a local source code directory. One should use this
-        when LIBFOO_SITE specifies a local directory path containing
-        the package source code. Buildroot copies the contents of the
-        source directory into the packages build directory. Note
-        that for local packages, no patches are applied. If you need
-        to still patch the source code, use LIBFOO_POST_RSYNC_HOOKS,
-        see Section18.22.1, Using the POST_RSYNC hook.
-  * LIBFOO_GIT_SUBMODULES can be set to YES to create an archive with
-    the git submodules in the repository. This is only available for
-    packages downloaded with git (i.e. when LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD=git).
-    Note that we try not to use such git submodules when they contain
-    bundled libraries, in which case we prefer to use those libraries
-    from their own package.
-  * LIBFOO_STRIP_COMPONENTS is the number of leading components
-    (directories) that tar must strip from file names on extraction.
-    The tarball for most packages has one leading component named "
-    <pkg-name>-<pkg-version>", thus Buildroot passes
-    --strip-components=1 to tar to remove it. For non-standard
-    packages that dont have this component, or that have more than
-    one leading component to strip, set this variable with the value
-    to be passed to tar. Default: 1.
-  * LIBFOO_EXCLUDES is a space-separated list of patterns to exclude
-    when extracting the archive. Each item from that list is passed
-    as a tars --exclude option. By default, empty.
-  * LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES lists the dependencies (in terms of package
-    name) that are required for the current target package to
-    compile. These dependencies are guaranteed to be compiled and
-    installed before the configuration of the current package starts.
-    However, modifications to configuration of these dependencies
-    will not force a rebuild of the current package. In a similar
-    way, HOST_LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES lists the dependencies for the
-    current host package.
-  * LIBFOO_EXTRACT_DEPENDENCIES lists the dependencies (in terms of
-    package name) that are required for the current target package to
-    be extracted. These dependencies are guaranteed to be compiled
-    and installed before the extract step of the current package
-    starts. This is only used internally by the package
-    infrastructure, and should typically not be used directly by
-    packages.
-  * LIBFOO_PATCH_DEPENDENCIES lists the dependencies (in terms of
-    package name) that are required for the current package to be
-    patched. These dependencies are guaranteed to be extracted and
-    patched (but not necessarily built) before the current package is
-    patched. In a similar way, HOST_LIBFOO_PATCH_DEPENDENCIES lists
-    the dependencies for the current host package. This is seldom
-    used; usually, LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES is what you really want to
-    use.
-  * LIBFOO_PROVIDES lists all the virtual packages libfoo is an
-    implementation of. See Section18.11, Infrastructure for virtual
-    packages.
-  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING can be set to YES or NO (default). If set
-    to YES, then the commands in the LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS
-    variables are executed to install the package into the staging
-    directory.
-  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET can be set to YES (default) or NO. If set
-    to YES, then the commands in the LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET_CMDS
-    variables are executed to install the package into the target
-    directory.
-  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_IMAGES can be set to YES or NO (default). If set
-    to YES, then the commands in the LIBFOO_INSTALL_IMAGES_CMDS
-    variable are executed to install the package into the images
-    directory.
-  * LIBFOO_CONFIG_SCRIPTS lists the names of the files in $
-    (STAGING_DIR)/usr/bin that need some special fixing to make them
-    cross-compiling friendly. Multiple file names separated by space
-    can be given and all are relative to $(STAGING_DIR)/usr/bin. The
-    files listed in LIBFOO_CONFIG_SCRIPTS are also removed from $
-    (TARGET_DIR)/usr/bin since they are not needed on the target.
-  * LIBFOO_DEVICES lists the device files to be created by Buildroot
-    when using the static device table. The syntax to use is the
-    makedevs one. You can find some documentation for this syntax in
-    the Chapter25, Makedev syntax documentation. This variable is
-    optional.
-  * LIBFOO_PERMISSIONS lists the changes of permissions to be done at
-    the end of the build process. The syntax is once again the
-    makedevs one. You can find some documentation for this syntax in
-    the Chapter25, Makedev syntax documentation. This variable is
-    optional.
-  * LIBFOO_USERS lists the users to create for this package, if it
-    installs a program you want to run as a specific user (e.g. as a
-    daemon, or as a cron-job). The syntax is similar in spirit to the
-    makedevs one, and is described in the Chapter26, Makeusers
-    syntax documentation. This variable is optional.
-  * LIBFOO_LICENSE defines the license (or licenses) under which the
-    package is released. This name will appear in the manifest file
-    produced by make legal-info. If the license appears in the SPDX
-    License List [https://spdx.org/licenses/], use the SPDX short
-    identifier to make the manifest file uniform. Otherwise, describe
-    the license in a precise and concise way, avoiding ambiguous
-    names such as BSD which actually name a family of licenses. This
-    variable is optional. If it is not defined, unknown will appear
-    in the license field of the manifest file for this package. The
-    expected format for this variable must comply with the following
-    rules:
-
-      + If different parts of the package are released under
-        different licenses, then comma separate licenses (e.g.
-        LIBFOO_LICENSE = GPL-2.0+, LGPL-2.1+). If there is clear
-        distinction between which component is licensed under what
-        license, then annotate the license with that component,
-        between parenthesis (e.g. LIBFOO_LICENSE = GPL-2.0+
-        (programs), LGPL-2.1+ (libraries)).
-      + If some licenses are conditioned on a sub-option being
-        enabled, append the conditional licenses with a comma (e.g.:
-        FOO_LICENSE += , GPL-2.0+ (programs)); the infrastructure
-        will internally remove the space before the comma.
-      + If the package is dual licensed, then separate licenses with
-        the or keyword (e.g. LIBFOO_LICENSE = AFL-2.1 or GPL-2.0+).
-  * LIBFOO_LICENSE_FILES is a space-separated list of files in the
-    package tarball that contain the license(s) under which the
-    package is released. make legal-info copies all of these files in
-    the legal-info directory. See Chapter13, Legal notice and
-    licensing for more information. This variable is optional. If it
-    is not defined, a warning will be produced to let you know, and
-    not saved will appear in the license files field of the manifest
-    file for this package.
-  * LIBFOO_ACTUAL_SOURCE_TARBALL only applies to packages whose
-    LIBFOO_SITE / LIBFOO_SOURCE pair points to an archive that does
-    not actually contain source code, but binary code. This a very
-    uncommon case, only known to apply to external toolchains which
-    come already compiled, although theoretically it might apply to
-    other packages. In such cases a separate tarball is usually
-    available with the actual source code. Set
-    LIBFOO_ACTUAL_SOURCE_TARBALL to the name of the actual source
-    code archive and Buildroot will download it and use it when you
-    run make legal-info to collect legally-relevant material. Note
-    this file will not be downloaded during regular builds nor by
-    make source.
-  * LIBFOO_ACTUAL_SOURCE_SITE provides the location of the actual
-    source tarball. The default value is LIBFOO_SITE, so you dont
-    need to set this variable if the binary and source archives are
-    hosted on the same directory. If LIBFOO_ACTUAL_SOURCE_TARBALL is
-    not set, it doesnt make sense to define
-    LIBFOO_ACTUAL_SOURCE_SITE.
-  * LIBFOO_REDISTRIBUTE can be set to YES (default) or NO to indicate
-    if the package source code is allowed to be redistributed. Set it
-    to NO for non-opensource packages: Buildroot will not save the
-    source code for this package when collecting the legal-info.
-  * LIBFOO_FLAT_STACKSIZE defines the stack size of an application
-    built into the FLAT binary format. The application stack size on
-    the NOMMU architecture processors cant be enlarged at run time.
-    The default stack size for the FLAT binary format is only 4k
-    bytes. If the application consumes more stack, append the
-    required number here.
-  * LIBFOO_BIN_ARCH_EXCLUDE is a space-separated list of paths
-    (relative to the target directory) to ignore when checking that
-    the package installs correctly cross-compiled binaries. You
-    seldom need to set this variable, unless the package installs
-    binary blobs outside the default locations, /lib/firmware, /usr/
-    lib/firmware, /lib/modules, /usr/lib/modules, and /usr/share,
-    which are automatically excluded.
-  * LIBFOO_IGNORE_CVES is a space-separated list of CVEs that tells
-    Buildroot CVE tracking tools which CVEs should be ignored for
-    this package. This is typically used when the CVE is fixed by a
-    patch in the package, or when the CVE for some reason does not
-    affect the Buildroot package. A Makefile comment must always
-    precede the addition of a CVE to this variable. Example:
-
-# 0001-fix-cve-2020-12345.patch
-LIBFOO_IGNORE_CVES += CVE-2020-12345
-# only when built with libbaz, which Buildroot doesn't support
-LIBFOO_IGNORE_CVES += CVE-2020-54321
-
-  * LIBFOO_CPE_ID_* variables is a set of variables that allows the
-    package to define its CPE identifier [https://nvd.nist.gov/
-    products/cpe]. The available variables are:
-
-      + LIBFOO_CPE_ID_PREFIX, specifies the prefix of the CPE
-        identifier, i.e the first three fields. When not defined, the
-        default value is cpe:2.3:a.
-      + LIBFOO_CPE_ID_VENDOR, specifies the vendor part of the CPE
-        identifier. When not defined, the default value is <pkgname>
-        _project.
-      + LIBFOO_CPE_ID_PRODUCT, specifies the product part of the CPE
-        identifier. When not defined, the default value is <pkgname>.
-      + LIBFOO_CPE_ID_VERSION, specifies the version part of the CPE
-        identifier. When not defined the default value is $
-        (LIBFOO_VERSION).
-      + LIBFOO_CPE_ID_UPDATE specifies the update part of the CPE
-        identifier. When not defined the default value is *.
-
-    If any of those variables is defined, then the generic package
-    infrastructure assumes the package provides valid CPE
-    information. In this case, the generic package infrastructure
-    will define LIBFOO_CPE_ID.
-
-    For a host package, if its LIBFOO_CPE_ID_* variables are not
-    defined, it inherits the value of those variables from the
-    corresponding target package.
-
-The recommended way to define these variables is to use the following
-syntax:
-
-LIBFOO_VERSION = 2.32
-
-Now, the variables that define what should be performed at the
-different steps of the build process.
-
-  * LIBFOO_EXTRACT_CMDS lists the actions to be performed to extract
-    the package. This is generally not needed as tarballs are
-    automatically handled by Buildroot. However, if the package uses
-    a non-standard archive format, such as a ZIP or RAR file, or has
-    a tarball with a non-standard organization, this variable allows
-    to override the package infrastructure default behavior.
-  * LIBFOO_CONFIGURE_CMDS lists the actions to be performed to
-    configure the package before its compilation.
-  * LIBFOO_BUILD_CMDS lists the actions to be performed to compile
-    the package.
-  * HOST_LIBFOO_INSTALL_CMDS lists the actions to be performed to
-    install the package, when the package is a host package. The
-    package must install its files to the directory given by $
-    (HOST_DIR). All files, including development files such as
-    headers should be installed, since other packages might be
-    compiled on top of this package.
-  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET_CMDS lists the actions to be performed to
-    install the package to the target directory, when the package is
-    a target package. The package must install its files to the
-    directory given by $(TARGET_DIR). Only the files required for 
-    execution of the package have to be installed. Header files,
-    static libraries and documentation will be removed again when the
-    target filesystem is finalized.
-  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS lists the actions to be performed to
-    install the package to the staging directory, when the package is
-    a target package. The package must install its files to the
-    directory given by $(STAGING_DIR). All development files should
-    be installed, since they might be needed to compile other
-    packages.
-  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_IMAGES_CMDS lists the actions to be performed to
-    install the package to the images directory, when the package is
-    a target package. The package must install its files to the
-    directory given by $(BINARIES_DIR). Only files that are binary
-    images (aka images) that do not belong in the TARGET_DIR but are
-    necessary for booting the board should be placed here. For
-    example, a package should utilize this step if it has binaries
-    which would be similar to the kernel image, bootloader or root
-    filesystem images.
-  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_INIT_SYSV, LIBFOO_INSTALL_INIT_OPENRC and
-    LIBFOO_INSTALL_INIT_SYSTEMD list the actions to install init
-    scripts either for the systemV-like init systems (busybox,
-    sysvinit, etc.), openrc or for the systemd units. These commands
-    will be run only when the relevant init system is installed (i.e.
-    if systemd is selected as the init system in the configuration,
-    only LIBFOO_INSTALL_INIT_SYSTEMD will be run). The only exception
-    is when openrc is chosen as init system and
-    LIBFOO_INSTALL_INIT_OPENRC has not been set, in such situation
-    LIBFOO_INSTALL_INIT_SYSV will be called, since openrc supports
-    sysv init scripts. When systemd is used as the init system,
-    buildroot will automatically enable all services using the
-    systemctl preset-all command in the final phase of image
-    building. You can add preset files to prevent a particular unit
-    from being automatically enabled by buildroot.
-  * LIBFOO_HELP_CMDS lists the actions to print the package help,
-    which is included to the main make help output. These commands
-    can print anything in any format. This is seldom used, as
-    packages rarely have custom rules. Do not use this variable,
-    unless you really know that you need to print help.
-  * LIBFOO_LINUX_CONFIG_FIXUPS lists the Linux kernel configuration
-    options that are needed to build and use this package, and
-    without which the package is fundamentally broken. This shall be
-    a set of calls to one of the kconfig tweaking option:
-    KCONFIG_ENABLE_OPT, KCONFIG_DISABLE_OPT, or KCONFIG_SET_OPT. This
-    is seldom used, as package usually have no strict requirements on
-    the kernel options.
-
-The preferred way to define these variables is:
-
-define LIBFOO_CONFIGURE_CMDS
-        action 1
-        action 2
-        action 3
-endef
-
-In the action definitions, you can use the following variables:
-
-  * $(LIBFOO_PKGDIR) contains the path to the directory containing
-    the libfoo.mk and Config.in files. This variable is useful when
-    it is necessary to install a file bundled in Buildroot, like a
-    runtime configuration file, a splashscreen image
-  * $(@D), which contains the directory in which the package source
-    code has been uncompressed.
-  * $(LIBFOO_DL_DIR) contains the path to the directory where all the
-    downloads made by Buildroot for libfoo are stored in.
-  * $(TARGET_CC), $(TARGET_LD), etc. to get the target
-    cross-compilation utilities
-  * $(TARGET_CROSS) to get the cross-compilation toolchain prefix
-  * Of course the $(HOST_DIR), $(STAGING_DIR) and $(TARGET_DIR)
-    variables to install the packages properly. Those variables point
-    to the global host, staging and target directories, unless 
-    per-package directory support is used, in which case they point
-    to the current package host, staging and target directories. In
-    both cases, it doesnt make any difference from the package point
-    of view: it should simply use HOST_DIR, STAGING_DIR and
-    TARGET_DIR. See Section8.12, Top-level parallel build for more
-    details about per-package directory support.
-
-Finally, you can also use hooks. See Section18.22, Hooks available
-in the various build steps for more information.

-14:
-15: $(eval $(autotools-package))
-
-On line 7, we declare the version of the package.
-
-On line 8 and 9, we declare the name of the tarball (xz-ed tarball
-recommended) and the location of the tarball on the Web. Buildroot
-will automatically download the tarball from this location.
-
-On line 10, we tell Buildroot to install the package to the staging
-directory. The staging directory, located in output/staging/ is the
-directory where all the packages are installed, including their
-development files, etc. By default, packages are not installed to the
-staging directory, since usually, only libraries need to be installed
-in the staging directory: their development files are needed to
-compile other libraries or applications depending on them. Also by
-default, when staging installation is enabled, packages are installed
-in this location using the make install command.
-
-On line 11, we tell Buildroot to not install the package to the
-target directory. This directory contains what will become the root
-filesystem running on the target. For purely static libraries, it is
-not necessary to install them in the target directory because they
-will not be used at runtime. By default, target installation is
-enabled; setting this variable to NO is almost never needed. Also by
-default, packages are installed in this location using the make
-install command.
-
-On line 12, we tell Buildroot to pass a custom configure option, that
-will be passed to the ./configure script before configuring and
-building the package.
-
-On line 13, we declare our dependencies, so that they are built
-before the build process of our package starts.
-
-Finally, on line line 15, we invoke the autotools-package macro that
-generates all the Makefile rules that actually allows the package to
-be built.
-
-18.6.2.autotools-package reference
-
-The main macro of the autotools package infrastructure is
-autotools-package. It is similar to the generic-package macro. The
-ability to have target and host packages is also available, with the
-host-autotools-package macro.
-
-Just like the generic infrastructure, the autotools infrastructure
-works by defining a number of variables before calling the
-autotools-package macro.
-
-First, all the package metadata information variables that exist in
-the generic infrastructure also exist in the autotools
-infrastructure: LIBFOO_VERSION, LIBFOO_SOURCE, LIBFOO_PATCH,
-LIBFOO_SITE, LIBFOO_SUBDIR, LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES,
-LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING, LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET.
-
-A few additional variables, specific to the autotools infrastructure,
-can also be defined. Many of them are only useful in very specific
-cases, typical packages will therefore only use a few of them.
-
-  * LIBFOO_SUBDIR may contain the name of a subdirectory inside the
-    package that contains the configure script. This is useful, if
-    for example, the main configure script is not at the root of the
-    tree extracted by the tarball. If HOST_LIBFOO_SUBDIR is not
-    specified, it defaults to LIBFOO_SUBDIR.
-  * LIBFOO_CONF_ENV, to specify additional environment variables to
-    pass to the configure script. By default, empty.
-  * LIBFOO_CONF_OPTS, to specify additional configure options to pass
-    to the configure script. By default, empty.
-  * LIBFOO_MAKE, to specify an alternate make command. This is
-    typically useful when parallel make is enabled in the
-    configuration (using BR2_JLEVEL) but that this feature should be
-    disabled for the given package, for one reason or another. By
-    default, set to $(MAKE). If parallel building is not supported by
-    the package, then it should be set to LIBFOO_MAKE=$(MAKE1).
-  * LIBFOO_MAKE_ENV, to specify additional environment variables to
-    pass to make in the build step. These are passed before the make
-    command. By default, empty.
-  * LIBFOO_MAKE_OPTS, to specify additional variables to pass to make
-    in the build step. These are passed after the make command. By
-    default, empty.
-  * LIBFOO_AUTORECONF, tells whether the package should be
-    autoreconfigured or not (i.e. if the configure script and
-    Makefile.in files should be re-generated by re-running autoconf,
-    automake, libtool, etc.). Valid values are YES and NO. By
-    default, the value is NO
-  * LIBFOO_AUTORECONF_ENV, to specify additional environment
-    variables to pass to the autoreconf program if LIBFOO_AUTORECONF=
-    YES. These are passed in the environment of the autoreconf
-    command. By default, empty.
-  * LIBFOO_AUTORECONF_OPTS to specify additional options passed to
-    the autoreconf program if LIBFOO_AUTORECONF=YES. By default,
-    empty.
-  * LIBFOO_GETTEXTIZE, tells whether the package should be
-    gettextized or not (i.e. if the package uses a different gettext
-    version than Buildroot provides, and it is needed to run 
-    gettextize.) Only valid when LIBFOO_AUTORECONF=YES. Valid values
-    are YES and NO. The default is NO.
-  * LIBFOO_GETTEXTIZE_OPTS, to specify additional options passed to
-    the gettextize program, if LIBFOO_GETTEXTIZE=YES. You may use
-    that if, for example, the .po files are not located in the
-    standard place (i.e. in po/ at the root of the package.) By
-    default, -f.
-  * LIBFOO_LIBTOOL_PATCH tells whether the Buildroot patch to fix
-    libtool cross-compilation issues should be applied or not. Valid
-    values are YES and NO. By default, the value is YES
-  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_OPTS contains the make options used to
-    install the package to the staging directory. By default, the
-    value is DESTDIR=$(STAGING_DIR) install, which is correct for
-    most autotools packages. It is still possible to override it.
-  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET_OPTS contains the make options used to
-    install the package to the target directory. By default, the
-    value is DESTDIR=$(TARGET_DIR) install. The default value is
-    correct for most autotools packages, but it is still possible to
-    override it if needed.
-
-With the autotools infrastructure, all the steps required to build
-and install the packages are already defined, and they generally work
-well for most autotools-based packages. However, when required, it is
-still possible to customize what is done in any particular step:
-
-  * By adding a post-operation hook (after extract, patch, configure,
-    build or install). See Section18.22, Hooks available in the
-    various build steps for details.
-  * By overriding one of the steps. For example, even if the
-    autotools infrastructure is used, if the package .mk file defines
-    its own LIBFOO_CONFIGURE_CMDS variable, it will be used instead
-    of the default autotools one. However, using this method should
-    be restricted to very specific cases. Do not use it in the
-    general case.

-First, all the package metadata information variables that exist in
-the generic infrastructure also exist in the CMake infrastructure:
-LIBFOO_VERSION, LIBFOO_SOURCE, LIBFOO_PATCH, LIBFOO_SITE,
-LIBFOO_SUBDIR, LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES, LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING,
-LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET.
-
-A few additional variables, specific to the CMake infrastructure, can
-also be defined. Many of them are only useful in very specific cases,
-typical packages will therefore only use a few of them.
-
-  * LIBFOO_SUBDIR may contain the name of a subdirectory inside the
-    package that contains the main CMakeLists.txt file. This is
-    useful, if for example, the main CMakeLists.txt file is not at
-    the root of the tree extracted by the tarball. If
-    HOST_LIBFOO_SUBDIR is not specified, it defaults to
-    LIBFOO_SUBDIR.
-  * LIBFOO_CONF_ENV, to specify additional environment variables to
-    pass to CMake. By default, empty.
-  * LIBFOO_CONF_OPTS, to specify additional configure options to pass
-    to CMake. By default, empty. A number of common CMake options are
-    set by the cmake-package infrastructure; so it is normally not
-    necessary to set them in the packages *.mk file unless you want
-    to override them:
-
-      + CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is driven by BR2_ENABLE_RUNTIME_DEBUG;
-      + CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX;
-      + BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is driven by BR2_STATIC_LIBS;
-      + BUILD_DOC, BUILD_DOCS are disabled;
-      + BUILD_EXAMPLE, BUILD_EXAMPLES are disabled;
-      + BUILD_TEST, BUILD_TESTS, BUILD_TESTING are disabled.
-  * LIBFOO_SUPPORTS_IN_SOURCE_BUILD = NO should be set when the
-    package cannot be built inside the source tree but needs a
-    separate build directory.
-  * LIBFOO_MAKE, to specify an alternate make command. This is
-    typically useful when parallel make is enabled in the
-    configuration (using BR2_JLEVEL) but that this feature should be
-    disabled for the given package, for one reason or another. By
-    default, set to $(MAKE). If parallel building is not supported by
-    the package, then it should be set to LIBFOO_MAKE=$(MAKE1).
-  * LIBFOO_MAKE_ENV, to specify additional environment variables to
-    pass to make in the build step. These are passed before the make
-    command. By default, empty.
-  * LIBFOO_MAKE_OPTS, to specify additional variables to pass to make
-    in the build step. These are passed after the make command. By
-    default, empty.
-  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_OPTS contains the make options used to install the
-    package to the host directory. By default, the value is install,
-    which is correct for most CMake packages. It is still possible to
-    override it.
-  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_OPTS contains the make options used to
-    install the package to the staging directory. By default, the
-    value is DESTDIR=$(STAGING_DIR) install/fast, which is correct
-    for most CMake packages. It is still possible to override it.
-  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET_OPTS contains the make options used to
-    install the package to the target directory. By default, the
-    value is DESTDIR=$(TARGET_DIR) install/fast. The default value is
-    correct for most CMake packages, but it is still possible to
-    override it if needed.
-
-With the CMake infrastructure, all the steps required to build and
-install the packages are already defined, and they generally work
-well for most CMake-based packages. However, when required, it is
-still possible to customize what is done in any particular step:
-
-  * By adding a post-operation hook (after extract, patch, configure,
-    build or install). See Section18.22, Hooks available in the
-    various build steps for details.
-  * By overriding one of the steps. For example, even if the CMake
-    infrastructure is used, if the package .mk file defines its own
-    LIBFOO_CONFIGURE_CMDS variable, it will be used instead of the
-    default CMake one. However, using this method should be
-    restricted to very specific cases. Do not use it in the general
-    case.

-18.8.Infrastructure for Python packages
-
-This infrastructure applies to Python packages that use the standard
-Python setuptools mechanism as their build system, generally
-recognizable by the usage of a setup.py script.
-
-18.8.1.python-package tutorial
-
-First, lets see how to write a .mk file for a Python package, with
-an example :
-
-01: ################################################################################
-02: #
-03: # python-foo
-04: #
-05: ################################################################################
-06:
-07: PYTHON_FOO_VERSION = 1.0
-08: PYTHON_FOO_SOURCE = python-foo-$(PYTHON_FOO_VERSION).tar.xz
-09: PYTHON_FOO_SITE = http://www.foosoftware.org/download
-10: PYTHON_FOO_LICENSE = BSD-3-Clause
-11: PYTHON_FOO_LICENSE_FILES = LICENSE
-12: PYTHON_FOO_ENV = SOME_VAR=1
-13: PYTHON_FOO_DEPENDENCIES = libmad
-14: PYTHON_FOO_SETUP_TYPE = distutils
-15:
-16: $(eval $(python-package))
-
-On line 7, we declare the version of the package.
-
-On line 8 and 9, we declare the name of the tarball (xz-ed tarball
-recommended) and the location of the tarball on the Web. Buildroot
-will automatically download the tarball from this location.
-
-On line 10 and 11, we give licensing details about the package (its
-license on line 10, and the file containing the license text on line
-11).
-
-On line 12, we tell Buildroot to pass custom options to the Python
-setup.py script when it is configuring the package.
-
-On line 13, we declare our dependencies, so that they are built
-before the build process of our package starts.
-
-On line 14, we declare the specific Python build system being used.
-In this case the distutils Python build system is used. The two
-supported ones are distutils and setuptools.
-
-Finally, on line 16, we invoke the python-package macro that
-generates all the Makefile rules that actually allow the package to
-be built.
-
-18.8.2.python-package reference
-
-As a policy, packages that merely provide Python modules should all
-be named python-<something> in Buildroot. Other packages that use the
-Python build system, but are not Python modules, can freely choose
-their name (existing examples in Buildroot are scons and supervisor).
-
-Packages that are only compatible with one version of Python (as in:
-Python 2 or Python 3) should depend on that version explicitely in
-their Config.in file (BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON for Python 2,
-BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON3 for Python 3). Packages that are compatible with
-both versions should not explicitely depend on them in their
-Config.in file, since that condition is already expressed for the
-whole "External python modules" menu.
-
-The main macro of the Python package infrastructure is
-python-package. It is similar to the generic-package macro. It is
-also possible to create Python host packages with the
-host-python-package macro.
-
-Just like the generic infrastructure, the Python infrastructure works
-by defining a number of variables before calling the python-package
-or host-python-package macros.
-
-All the package metadata information variables that exist in the
-generic package infrastructure also exist in the Python
-infrastructure: PYTHON_FOO_VERSION, PYTHON_FOO_SOURCE,
-PYTHON_FOO_PATCH, PYTHON_FOO_SITE, PYTHON_FOO_SUBDIR,
-PYTHON_FOO_DEPENDENCIES, PYTHON_FOO_LICENSE,
-PYTHON_FOO_LICENSE_FILES, PYTHON_FOO_INSTALL_STAGING, etc.
-
-Note that:
-
-  * It is not necessary to add python or host-python in the
-    PYTHON_FOO_DEPENDENCIES variable of a package, since these basic
-    dependencies are automatically added as needed by the Python
-    package infrastructure.
-  * Similarly, it is not needed to add host-setuptools to
-    PYTHON_FOO_DEPENDENCIES for setuptools-based packages, since its
-    automatically added by the Python infrastructure as needed.
-
-One variable specific to the Python infrastructure is mandatory:
-
-  * PYTHON_FOO_SETUP_TYPE, to define which Python build system is
-    used by the package. The two supported values are distutils and
-    setuptools. If you dont know which one is used in your package,
-    look at the setup.py file in your package source code, and see
-    whether it imports things from the distutils module or the
-    setuptools module.
-
-A few additional variables, specific to the Python infrastructure,
-can optionally be defined, depending on the packages needs. Many of
-them are only useful in very specific cases, typical packages will
-therefore only use a few of them, or none.
-
-  * PYTHON_FOO_SUBDIR may contain the name of a subdirectory inside
-    the package that contains the main setup.py file. This is useful,
-    if for example, the main setup.py file is not at the root of the
-    tree extracted by the tarball. If HOST_PYTHON_FOO_SUBDIR is not
-    specified, it defaults to PYTHON_FOO_SUBDIR.
-  * PYTHON_FOO_ENV, to specify additional environment variables to
-    pass to the Python setup.py script (for both the build and
-    install steps). Note that the infrastructure is automatically
-    passing several standard variables, defined in
-    PKG_PYTHON_DISTUTILS_ENV (for distutils target packages),
-    HOST_PKG_PYTHON_DISTUTILS_ENV (for distutils host packages),
-    PKG_PYTHON_SETUPTOOLS_ENV (for setuptools target packages) and
-    HOST_PKG_PYTHON_SETUPTOOLS_ENV (for setuptools host packages).
-  * PYTHON_FOO_BUILD_OPTS, to specify additional options to pass to
-    the Python setup.py script during the build step. For target
-    distutils packages, the PKG_PYTHON_DISTUTILS_BUILD_OPTS options
-    are already passed automatically by the infrastructure.
-  * PYTHON_FOO_INSTALL_TARGET_OPTS, PYTHON_FOO_INSTALL_STAGING_OPTS,
-    HOST_PYTHON_FOO_INSTALL_OPTS to specify additional options to
-    pass to the Python setup.py script during the target installation
-    step, the staging installation step or the host installation,
-    respectively. Note that the infrastructure is automatically
-    passing some options, defined in
-    PKG_PYTHON_DISTUTILS_INSTALL_TARGET_OPTS or
-    PKG_PYTHON_DISTUTILS_INSTALL_STAGING_OPTS (for target distutils
-    packages), HOST_PKG_PYTHON_DISTUTILS_INSTALL_OPTS (for host
-    distutils packages), PKG_PYTHON_SETUPTOOLS_INSTALL_TARGET_OPTS or
-    PKG_PYTHON_SETUPTOOLS_INSTALL_STAGING_OPTS (for target setuptools
-    packages) and HOST_PKG_PYTHON_SETUPTOOLS_INSTALL_OPTS (for host
-    setuptools packages).
-  * HOST_PYTHON_FOO_NEEDS_HOST_PYTHON, to define the host python
-    interpreter. The usage of this variable is limited to host
-    packages. The two supported value are python2 and python3. It
-    will ensure the right host python package is available and will
-    invoke it for the build. If some build steps are overloaded, the
-    right python interpreter must be explicitly called in the
-    commands.
-
-With the Python infrastructure, all the steps required to build and
-install the packages are already defined, and they generally work
-well for most Python-based packages. However, when required, it is
-still possible to customize what is done in any particular step:
-
-  * By adding a post-operation hook (after extract, patch, configure,
-    build or install). See Section18.22, Hooks available in the
-    various build steps for details.
-  * By overriding one of the steps. For example, even if the Python
-    infrastructure is used, if the package .mk file defines its own
-    PYTHON_FOO_BUILD_CMDS variable, it will be used instead of the
-    default Python one. However, using this method should be
-    restricted to very specific cases. Do not use it in the general
-    case.
-
-18.8.3.Generating a python-package from a PyPI repository
-
-If the Python package for which you would like to create a Buildroot
-package is available on PyPI, you may want to use the scanpypi tool
-located in utils/ to automate the process.
-
-You can find the list of existing PyPI packages here [https://
-pypi.python.org].
-
-scanpypi requires Pythons setuptools package to be installed on your
-host.
-
-When at the root of your buildroot directory just do :
-
-utils/scanpypi foo bar -o package
-
-This will generate packages python-foo and python-bar in the package
-folder if they exist on https://pypi.python.org.
-
-Find the external python modules menu and insert your package inside.
-Keep in mind that the items inside a menu should be in alphabetical
-order.
-
-Please keep in mind that youll most likely have to manually check
-the package for any mistakes as there are things that cannot be
-guessed by the generator (e.g. dependencies on any of the python core
-modules such as BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON_ZLIB). Also, please take note that
-the license and license files are guessed and must be checked. You
-also need to manually add the package to the package/Config.in file.
-
-If your Buildroot package is not in the official Buildroot tree but
-in a br2-external tree, use the -o flag as follows:
-
-utils/scanpypi foo bar -o other_package_dir
-
-This will generate packages python-foo and python-bar in the
-other_package_directory instead of package.
-
-Option -h will list the available options:
-
-utils/scanpypi -h
-
-18.8.4.python-package CFFI backend
-
-C Foreign Function Interface for Python (CFFI) provides a convenient
-and reliable way to call compiled C code from Python using interface
-declarations written in C. Python packages relying on this backend
-can be identified by the appearance of a cffi dependency in the
-install_requires field of their setup.py file.
-
-Such a package should:
-
-  * add python-cffi as a runtime dependency in order to install the
-    compiled C library wrapper on the target. This is achieved by
-    adding select BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON_CFFI to the package Config.in.
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON_FOO
-        bool "python-foo"
-        select BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON_CFFI # runtime
-
-  * add host-python-cffi as a build-time dependency in order to
-    cross-compile the C wrapper. This is achieved by adding
-    host-python-cffi to the PYTHON_FOO_DEPENDENCIES variable.

-
-01: ################################################################################
-02: #

-04: #
-05: ################################################################################
-06:

-13: LUA_FOO_LICENSE = luaFoo license
-14: LUA_FOO_LICENSE_FILES = $(LUA_FOO_SUBDIR)/COPYING
-15:
-16: $(eval $(luarocks-package))
-
-On line 7, we declare the version of the package (the same as in the
-rockspec, which is the concatenation of the upstream version and the
-rockspec revision, separated by a hyphen -).
-
-On line 8, we declare that the package is called "foo" on LuaRocks.
-In Buildroot, we give Lua-related packages a name that starts with
-"lua", so the Buildroot name is different from the upstream name.
-LUA_FOO_NAME_UPSTREAM makes the link between the two names.
-
-On line 9, we declare our dependencies against native libraries, so
-that they are built before the build process of our package starts.
-
-On lines 11-12, we tell Buildroot to pass custom options to LuaRocks
-when it is building the package.
-
-On lines 13-14, we specify the licensing terms for the package.
-
-Finally, on line 16, we invoke the luarocks-package macro that
-generates all the Makefile rules that actually allows the package to
-be built.
-
-Most of these details can be retrieved from the rock and rockspec.
-So, this file and the Config.in file can be generated by running the
-command luarocks buildroot foo lua-foo in the Buildroot directory.
-This command runs a specific Buildroot addon of luarocks that will
-automatically generate a Buildroot package. The result must still be
-manually inspected and possibly modified.
-
-  * The package/Config.in file has to be updated manually to include
-    the generated Config.in files.
-
-18.9.2.luarocks-package reference
-
-LuaRocks is a deployment and management system for Lua modules, and
-supports various build.type: builtin, make and cmake. In the context
-of Buildroot, the luarocks-package infrastructure only supports the
-builtin mode. LuaRocks packages that use the make or cmake build
-mechanisms should instead be packaged using the generic-package and
-cmake-package infrastructures in Buildroot, respectively.
-
-The main macro of the LuaRocks package infrastructure is
-luarocks-package: like generic-package it works by defining a number
-of variables providing metadata information about the package, and
-then calling luarocks-package.
-
-Just like the generic infrastructure, the LuaRocks infrastructure
-works by defining a number of variables before calling the

-LUA_FOO_VERSION, LUA_FOO_SOURCE, LUA_FOO_SITE, LUA_FOO_DEPENDENCIES,
-LUA_FOO_LICENSE, LUA_FOO_LICENSE_FILES.
-
-Two of them are populated by the LuaRocks infrastructure (for the
-download step). If your package is not hosted on the LuaRocks mirror
-$(BR2_LUAROCKS_MIRROR), you can override them:
-
-  * LUA_FOO_SITE, which defaults to $(BR2_LUAROCKS_MIRROR)
-  * LUA_FOO_SOURCE, which defaults to $(lowercase
-    LUA_FOO_NAME_UPSTREAM)-$(LUA_FOO_VERSION).src.rock
-
-A few additional variables, specific to the LuaRocks infrastructure,
-are also defined. They can be overridden in specific cases.
-
-  * LUA_FOO_NAME_UPSTREAM, which defaults to lua-foo, i.e. the
-    Buildroot package name
-  * LUA_FOO_ROCKSPEC, which defaults to $(lowercase
-    LUA_FOO_NAME_UPSTREAM)-$(LUA_FOO_VERSION).rockspec
-  * LUA_FOO_SUBDIR, which defaults to $(LUA_FOO_NAME_UPSTREAM)-$
-    (LUA_FOO_VERSION_WITHOUT_ROCKSPEC_REVISION)
-  * LUA_FOO_BUILD_OPTS contains additional build options for the

-
-On line 13, the name of the distribution as needed by the script
-utils/scancpan (in order to regenerate/upgrade these package files).
-
-Finally, on line 15, we invoke the perl-package macro that generates

-
-Most of these data can be retrieved from https://metacpan.org/. So,
-this file and the Config.in can be generated by running the script
-utils/scancpan Foo-Bar in the Buildroot directory (or in a
-br2-external tree). This script creates a Config.in file and
-foo-bar.mk file for the requested package, and also recursively for
-all dependencies specified by CPAN. You should still manually edit
-the result. In particular, the following things should be checked.
-
-  * If the perl module links with a shared library that is provided
-    by another (non-perl) package, this dependency is not added
-    automatically. It has to be added manually to
-    PERL_FOO_BAR_DEPENDENCIES.
-  * The package/Config.in file has to be updated manually to include
-    the generated Config.in files. As a hint, the scancpan script
-    prints out the required source "" statements, sorted
-    alphabetically.
-
-18.10.2.perl-package reference
-
-As a policy, packages that provide Perl/CPAN modules should all be
-named perl-<something> in Buildroot.
-
-This infrastructure handles various Perl build systems :
-ExtUtils-MakeMaker (EUMM), Module-Build (MB) and Module-Build-Tiny.
-Build.PL is preferred by default when a package provides a

-
-The main macro of the Perl/CPAN package infrastructure is

-PERL_FOO_INSTALL_TARGET.
-
-Note that setting PERL_FOO_INSTALL_STAGING to YES has no effect
-unless a PERL_FOO_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS variable is defined. The perl
-infrastructure doesnt define these commands since Perl modules
-generally dont need to be installed to the staging directory.
-
-A few additional variables, specific to the Perl/CPAN infrastructure,
-can also be defined. Many of them are only useful in very specific
-cases, typical packages will therefore only use a few of them.
-
-  * PERL_FOO_PREFER_INSTALLER/HOST_PERL_FOO_PREFER_INSTALLER,
-    specifies the preferred installation method. Possible values are
-    EUMM (for Makefile.PL based installation using
-    ExtUtils-MakeMaker) and MB (for Build.PL based installation using
-    Module-Build). This variable is only used when the package
-    provides both installation methods.
-  * PERL_FOO_CONF_ENV/HOST_PERL_FOO_CONF_ENV, to specify additional
-    environment variables to pass to the perl Makefile.PL or perl

-18.11.Infrastructure for virtual packages
-
-In Buildroot, a virtual package is a package whose functionalities
-are provided by one or more packages, referred to as providers. The
-virtual package management is an extensible mechanism allowing the
-user to choose the provider used in the rootfs.
-
-For example, OpenGL ES is an API for 2D and 3D graphics on embedded
-systems. The implementation of this API is different for the 
-Allwinner Tech Sunxi and the Texas Instruments OMAP35xx platforms. So
-libgles will be a virtual package and sunxi-mali and ti-gfx will be
-the providers.
-
-18.11.1.virtual-package tutorial
-
-In the following example, we will explain how to add a new virtual
-package (something-virtual) and a provider for it (some-provider).
-
-First, lets create the virtual package.
-
-18.11.2.Virtual packages Config.in file
-
-The Config.in file of virtual package something-virtual should
-contain:
-
-01: config BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_SOMETHING_VIRTUAL
-02:     bool
-03:
-04: config BR2_PACKAGE_PROVIDES_SOMETHING_VIRTUAL
-05:     depends on BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_SOMETHING_VIRTUAL
-06:     string
-
-In this file, we declare two options,
-BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_SOMETHING_VIRTUAL and
-BR2_PACKAGE_PROVIDES_SOMETHING_VIRTUAL, whose values will be used by
-the providers.
-
-18.11.3.Virtual packages .mk file
-
-The .mk for the virtual package should just evaluate the
-virtual-package macro:
-
-01: ################################################################################
-02: #
-03: # something-virtual
-04: #
-05: ################################################################################
-06:
-07: $(eval $(virtual-package))
-
-The ability to have target and host packages is also available, with
-the host-virtual-package macro.
-
-18.11.4.Providers Config.in file
-
-When adding a package as a provider, only the Config.in file requires
-some modifications.
-
-The Config.in file of the package some-provider, which provides the
-functionalities of something-virtual, should contain:
-
-01: config BR2_PACKAGE_SOME_PROVIDER

-12: endif
-
-On line 3, we select BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_SOMETHING_VIRTUAL, and on line
-11, we set the value of BR2_PACKAGE_PROVIDES_SOMETHING_VIRTUAL to the
-name of the provider, but only if it is selected.
-
-18.11.5.Providers .mk file
-
-The .mk file should also declare an additional variable
-SOME_PROVIDER_PROVIDES to contain the names of all the virtual
-packages it is an implementation of:
-
-01: SOME_PROVIDER_PROVIDES = something-virtual
-
-Of course, do not forget to add the proper build and runtime
-dependencies for this package!
-
-18.11.6.Notes on depending on a virtual package
-
-When adding a package that requires a certain FEATURE provided by a
-virtual package, you have to use depends on BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_FEATURE,
-like so:
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_FEATURE
-    bool
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_FOO
-    bool "foo"
-    depends on BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_FEATURE
-
-18.11.7.Notes on depending on a specific provider
-
-If your package really requires a specific provider, then youll have
-to make your package depends on this provider; you can not select a
-provider.
-
-Lets take an example with two providers for a FEATURE:
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_FEATURE
-    bool
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_FOO
-    bool "foo"
-    select BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_FEATURE
-
-config BR2_PACKAGE_BAR
-    bool "bar"
-    select BR2_PACKAGE_HAS_FEATURE
-
-And you are adding a package that needs FEATURE as provided by foo,
-but not as provided by bar.
-
-If you were to use select BR2_PACKAGE_FOO, then the user would still
-be able to select BR2_PACKAGE_BAR in the menuconfig. This would
-create a configuration inconsistency, whereby two providers of the
-same FEATURE would be enabled at once, one explicitly set by the
-user, the other implicitly by your select.
-
-Instead, you have to use depends on BR2_PACKAGE_FOO, which avoids any
-implicit configuration inconsistency.

-18.12.Infrastructure for packages using kconfig for configuration
-files
-
-A popular way for a software package to handle user-specified
-configuration is kconfig. Among others, it is used by the Linux
-kernel, Busybox, and Buildroot itself. The presence of a .config file
-and a menuconfig target are two well-known symptoms of kconfig being
-used.
-
-Buildroot features an infrastructure for packages that use kconfig
-for their configuration. This infrastructure provides the necessary
-logic to expose the packages menuconfig target as foo-menuconfig in
-Buildroot, and to handle the copying back and forth of the
-configuration file in a correct way.
-
-The kconfig-package infrastructure is based on the generic-package
-infrastructure. All variables supported by generic-package are
-available in kconfig-package as well. See Section18.5.2,
-generic-package reference for more details.
-
-In order to use the kconfig-package infrastructure for a Buildroot
-package, the minimally required lines in the .mk file, in addition to
-the variables required by the generic-package infrastructure, are:
-
-FOO_KCONFIG_FILE = reference-to-source-configuration-file
-
-$(eval $(kconfig-package))
-
-This snippet creates the following make targets:
-
-  * foo-menuconfig, which calls the packages menuconfig target
-  * foo-update-config, which copies the configuration back to the
-    source configuration file. It is not possible to use this target
-    when fragment files are set.
-  * foo-update-defconfig, which copies the configuration back to the
-    source configuration file. The configuration file will only list
-    the options that differ from the default values. It is not
-    possible to use this target when fragment files are set.
-  * foo-diff-config, which outputs the differences between the
-    current configuration and the one defined in the Buildroot
-    configuration for this kconfig package. The output is useful to
-    identify the configuration changes that may have to be propagated
-    to configuration fragments for example.
-
-and ensures that the source configuration file is copied to the build
-directory at the right moment.
-
-There are two options to specify a configuration file to use, either
-FOO_KCONFIG_FILE (as in the example, above) or FOO_KCONFIG_DEFCONFIG.
-It is mandatory to provide either, but not both:
-
-  * FOO_KCONFIG_FILE specifies the path to a defconfig or full-config
-    file to be used to configure the package.
-  * FOO_KCONFIG_DEFCONFIG specifies the defconfig make rule to call
-    to configure the package.
-
-In addition to these minimally required lines, several optional
-variables can be set to suit the needs of the package under
-consideration:
-
-  * FOO_KCONFIG_EDITORS: a space-separated list of kconfig editors to
-    support, for example menuconfig xconfig. By default, menuconfig.
-  * FOO_KCONFIG_FRAGMENT_FILES: a space-separated list of
-    configuration fragment files that are merged to the main
-    configuration file. Fragment files are typically used when there
-    is a desire to stay in sync with an upstream (def)config file,
-    with some minor modifications.
-  * FOO_KCONFIG_OPTS: extra options to pass when calling the kconfig
-    editors. This may need to include $(FOO_MAKE_OPTS), for example.
-    By default, empty.
-  * FOO_KCONFIG_FIXUP_CMDS: a list of shell commands needed to fixup
-    the configuration file after copying it or running a kconfig
-    editor. Such commands may be needed to ensure a configuration
-    consistent with other configuration of Buildroot, for example. By
-    default, empty.
-  * FOO_KCONFIG_DOTCONFIG: path (with filename) of the .config file,
-    relative to the package source tree. The default, .config, should
-    be well suited for all packages that use the standard kconfig
-    infrastructure as inherited from the Linux kernel; some packages
-    use a derivative of kconfig that use a different location.
-  * FOO_KCONFIG_DEPENDENCIES: the list of packages (most probably,
-    host packages) that need to be built before this packages
-    kconfig is interpreted. Seldom used. By default, empty.
-  * FOO_KCONFIG_SUPPORTS_DEFCONFIG: whether the packages kconfig
-    system supports using defconfig files; few packages do not. By
-    default, YES.

-11:
-12: $(eval $(rebar-package))
-
-On line 7, we declare the version of the package.
-
-On line 8 and 9, we declare the name of the tarball (xz-ed tarball
-recommended) and the location of the tarball on the Web. Buildroot
-will automatically download the tarball from this location.
-
-On line 10, we declare our dependencies, so that they are built
-before the build process of our package starts.
-
-Finally, on line 12, we invoke the rebar-package macro that generates
-all the Makefile rules that actually allows the package to be built.
-
-18.13.2.rebar-package reference
-
-The main macro of the rebar package infrastructure is rebar-package.
-It is similar to the generic-package macro. The ability to have host
-packages is also available, with the host-rebar-package macro.
-
-Just like the generic infrastructure, the rebar infrastructure works
-by defining a number of variables before calling the rebar-package
-macro.
-
-First, all the package metadata information variables that exist in
-the generic infrastructure also exist in the rebar infrastructure:
-ERLANG_FOOBAR_VERSION, ERLANG_FOOBAR_SOURCE, ERLANG_FOOBAR_PATCH,
-ERLANG_FOOBAR_SITE, ERLANG_FOOBAR_SUBDIR, ERLANG_FOOBAR_DEPENDENCIES,
-ERLANG_FOOBAR_INSTALL_STAGING, ERLANG_FOOBAR_INSTALL_TARGET,
-ERLANG_FOOBAR_LICENSE and ERLANG_FOOBAR_LICENSE_FILES.
-
-A few additional variables, specific to the rebar infrastructure, can
-also be defined. Many of them are only useful in very specific cases,
-typical packages will therefore only use a few of them.
-
-  * ERLANG_FOOBAR_USE_AUTOCONF, to specify that the package uses 
-    autoconf at the configuration step. When a package sets this
-    variable to YES, the autotools infrastructure is used.
-
-    Note.You can also use some of the variables from the autotools
-    infrastructure: ERLANG_FOOBAR_CONF_ENV, ERLANG_FOOBAR_CONF_OPTS,
-    ERLANG_FOOBAR_AUTORECONF, ERLANG_FOOBAR_AUTORECONF_ENV and
-    ERLANG_FOOBAR_AUTORECONF_OPTS.
-
-  * ERLANG_FOOBAR_USE_BUNDLED_REBAR, to specify that the package has
-    a bundled version of rebar and that it shall be used. Valid
-    values are YES or NO (the default).
-
-    Note.If the package bundles a rebar utility, but can use the
-    generic one that Buildroot provides, just say NO (i.e., do not
-    specify this variable). Only set if it is mandatory to use the 
-    rebar utility bundled in this package.
-
-  * ERLANG_FOOBAR_REBAR_ENV, to specify additional environment
-    variables to pass to the rebar utility.
-  * ERLANG_FOOBAR_KEEP_DEPENDENCIES, to keep the dependencies
-    described in the rebar.config file. Valid values are YES or NO
-    (the default). Unless this variable is set to YES, the rebar
-    infrastructure removes such dependencies in a post-patch hook to
-    ensure rebar does not download nor compile them.
-
-With the rebar infrastructure, all the steps required to build and
-install the packages are already defined, and they generally work
-well for most rebar-based packages. However, when required, it is
-still possible to customize what is done in any particular step:
-
-  * By adding a post-operation hook (after extract, patch, configure,
-    build or install). See Section18.22, Hooks available in the
-    various build steps for details.
-  * By overriding one of the steps. For example, even if the rebar
-    infrastructure is used, if the package .mk file defines its own
-    ERLANG_FOOBAR_BUILD_CMDS variable, it will be used instead of the
-    default rebar one. However, using this method should be
-    restricted to very specific cases. Do not use it in the general
-    case.

-18.15.1.meson-package tutorial
-
-Meson [http://mesonbuild.com] is an open source build system meant to
-be both extremely fast, and, even more importantly, as user friendly
-as possible. It uses Ninja [https://ninja-build.org] as a companion

-
-Lets see how to write a .mk file for a Meson-based package, with an
-example:
-

-
-Note that it is not necessary to add host-meson in the

-is automatically added as needed by the Meson package infrastructure.
-
-If the "baz" package is selected, then support for the "baz" feature
-in "foo" is activated by adding -Dbaz=true to FOO_CONF_OPTS at line

-The "baz" package is also added to FOO_DEPENDENCIES. Note that the
-support for baz is explicitly disabled at line 20, if the package is

-18.16.Integration of Cargo-based packages
-
-Cargo is the package manager for the Rust programming language. It
-allows the user to build programs or libraries written in Rust, but
-it also downloads and manages their dependencies, to ensure
-repeatable builds. Cargo packages are called "crates".
-
-18.16.1.Cargo-based packages Config.in file
-
-The Config.in file of Cargo-based package foo should contain:
-
-01: config BR2_PACKAGE_FOO
-02:     bool "foo"
-03:     depends on BR2_PACKAGE_HOST_RUSTC_TARGET_ARCH_SUPPORTS
-04:     select BR2_PACKAGE_HOST_RUSTC
-05:     help

-
-18.16.2.Cargo-based packages .mk file
-
-Buildroot does not (yet) provide a dedicated package infrastructure
-for Cargo-based packages. So, we will explain how to write a .mk file
-for such a package. Lets start with an example:
-

-31:             $(TARGET_DIR)/usr/bin/foo
-32: endef
-33:
-34: $(eval $(generic-package))
-
-The Makefile starts with the definition of the standard variables for
-package declaration (lines 7 to 11).
-
-As seen in line 34, it is based on the generic-package infrastructure
-. So, it defines the variables required by this particular
-infrastructure, where Cargo is invoked:
-
-  * FOO_BUILD_CMDS: Cargo is invoked to perform the build. The
-    options required to configure the cross-compilation of the
-    package are passed via FOO_CONF_OPTS.
-  * FOO_INSTALL_TARGET_CMDS: The binary executable generated is
-    installed on the target.
-
-In order to have Cargo available for the build, FOO_DEPENDENCIES
-needs to contain host-cargo.
-
-To sum it up, to add a new Cargo-based package, the Makefile example
-can be copied verbatim then edited to replace all occurences of FOO
-with the uppercase name of the new package and update the values of
-the standard variables.
-
-18.16.3.About Dependencies Management
-
-A crate can depend on other libraries from crates.io or git
-repositories, listed in its Cargo.toml file. Before starting a build,
-Cargo usually downloads automatically them. This step can also be
-performed independently, via the cargo fetch command.
-
-Cargo maintains a local cache of the registry index and of git
-checkouts of the crates, whose location is given by $CARGO_HOME. As
-seen in the package Makefile example at line 15, this environment
-variable is set to $(HOST_DIR)/share/cargo.
-
-This dependency download mechanism is not convenient when performing
-an offline build, as Cargo will fail to fetch the dependencies. In
-that case, it is advised to generate a tarball of the dependencies
-using the cargo vendor and add it to FOO_EXTRA_DOWNLOADS.

-
-18.17.2.golang-package reference
-
-In their Config.in file, packages using the golang-package
-infrastructure should depend on
-BR2_PACKAGE_HOST_GO_TARGET_ARCH_SUPPORTS because Buildroot will

-
-The main macro of the Go package infrastructure is golang-package. It
-is similar to the generic-package macro. The ability to build host
-packages is also available, with the host-golang-package macro. Host
-packages built by host-golang-package macro should depend on

-Note that it is not necessary to add host-go in the FOO_DEPENDENCIES
-variable of a package, since this basic dependency is automatically
-added as needed by the Go package infrastructure.
-
-A few additional variables, specific to the Go infrastructure, can
-optionally be defined, depending on the packages needs. Many of them
-are only useful in very specific cases, typical packages will
-therefore only use a few of them, or none.
-
-  * The package must specify its Go module name in the FOO_GOMOD
-    variable. If not specified, it defaults to URL-domain/
-    1st-part-of-URL/2nd-part-of-URL, e.g FOO_GOMOD will take the
-    value github.com/bar/foo for a package that specifies FOO_SITE =
-    $(call github,bar,foo,$(FOO_VERSION)). The Go package
-    infrastructure will automatically generate a minimal go.mod file
-    in the package source tree if it doesnt exist.
-  * FOO_LDFLAGS and FOO_TAGS can be used to pass respectively the
-    LDFLAGS or the TAGS to the go build command.
-  * FOO_BUILD_TARGETS can be used to pass the list of targets that
-    should be built. If FOO_BUILD_TARGETS is not specified, it
-    defaults to .. We then have two cases:
-
-      + FOO_BUILD_TARGETS is .. In this case, we assume only one
-        binary will be produced, and that by default we name it after
-        the package name. If that is not appropriate, the name of the
-        produced binary can be overridden using FOO_BIN_NAME.
-      + FOO_BUILD_TARGETS is not .. In this case, we iterate over the
-        values to build each target, and for each produced a binary
-        that is the non-directory component of the target. For
-        example if FOO_BUILD_TARGETS = cmd/docker cmd/dockerd the
-        binaries produced are docker and dockerd.
-  * FOO_INSTALL_BINS can be used to pass the list of binaries that
-    should be installed in /usr/bin on the target. If
-    FOO_INSTALL_BINS is not specified, it defaults to the lower-case
-    name of package.
-
-With the Go infrastructure, all the steps required to build and
-install the packages are already defined, and they generally work
-well for most Go-based packages. However, when required, it is still
-possible to customize what is done in any particular step:
-
-  * By adding a post-operation hook (after extract, patch, configure,
-    build or install). See Section18.22, Hooks available in the
-    various build steps for details.
-  * By overriding one of the steps. For example, even if the Go
-    infrastructure is used, if the package .mk file defines its own
-    FOO_BUILD_CMDS variable, it will be used instead of the default
-    Go one. However, using this method should be restricted to very
-    specific cases. Do not use it in the general case.

-18.18.Infrastructure for QMake-based packages
-
-18.18.1.qmake-package tutorial
-
-First, lets see how to write a .mk file for a QMake-based package,
-with an example :
-
-01: ################################################################################
-02: #
-03: # libfoo
-04: #
-05: ################################################################################
-06:
-07: LIBFOO_VERSION = 1.0
-08: LIBFOO_SOURCE = libfoo-$(LIBFOO_VERSION).tar.gz
-09: LIBFOO_SITE = http://www.foosoftware.org/download
-10: LIBFOO_CONF_OPTS = QT_CONFIG+=bar QT_CONFIG-=baz
-11: LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES = bar
-12:
-13: $(eval $(qmake-package))
-
-On line 7, we declare the version of the package.
-
-On line 8 and 9, we declare the name of the tarball (xz-ed tarball
-recommended) and the location of the tarball on the Web. Buildroot
-will automatically download the tarball from this location.
-
-On line 10, we tell Buildroot what options to enable for libfoo.
-
-On line 11, we tell Buildroot the dependencies of libfoo.
-
-Finally, on line line 13, we invoke the qmake-package macro that
-generates all the Makefile rules that actually allows the package to
-be built.
-
-18.18.2.qmake-package reference
-
-The main macro of the QMake package infrastructure is qmake-package.
-It is similar to the generic-package macro.
-
-Just like the generic infrastructure, the QMake infrastructure works
-by defining a number of variables before calling the qmake-package
-macro.
-
-First, all the package metadata information variables that exist in
-the generic infrastructure also exist in the QMake infrastructure:
-LIBFOO_VERSION, LIBFOO_SOURCE, LIBFOO_PATCH, LIBFOO_SITE,
-LIBFOO_SUBDIR, LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES, LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING,
-LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET.
-
-An additional variable, specific to the QMake infrastructure, can
-also be defined.
-
-  * LIBFOO_CONF_ENV, to specify additional environment variables to
-    pass to the qmake script for the configuration step. By default,
-    empty.
-  * LIBFOO_CONF_OPTS, to specify additional options to pass to the
-    qmake script for the configuration step. By default, empty.
-  * LIBFOO_MAKE_ENV, to specify additional environment variables to
-    the make command during the build and install steps. By default,
-    empty.
-  * LIBFOO_MAKE_OPTS, to specify additional targets to pass to the
-    make command during the build step. By default, empty.
-  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_OPTS, to specify additional targets to
-    pass to the make command during the staging installation step. By
-    default, install.
-  * LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET_OPTS, to specify additional targets to pass
-    to the make command during the target installation step. By
-    default, install.
-  * LIBFOO_SYNC_QT_HEADERS, to run syncqt.pl before qmake. Some
-    packages need this to have a properly populated include directory
-    before running the build.
-
-18.19.Infrastructure for packages building kernel modules
-
-Buildroot offers a helper infrastructure to make it easy to write
-packages that build and install Linux kernel modules. Some packages
-only contain a kernel module, other packages contain programs and
-libraries in addition to kernel modules. Buildroots helper
-infrastructure supports either case.
-
-18.19.1.kernel-module tutorial
-
-Lets start with an example on how to prepare a simple package that
-only builds a kernel module, and no other component:
-
-01: ################################################################################
-02: #
-03: # foo
-04: #
-05: ################################################################################
-06:
-07: FOO_VERSION = 1.2.3
-08: FOO_SOURCE = foo-$(FOO_VERSION).tar.xz
-09: FOO_SITE = http://www.foosoftware.org/download
-10: FOO_LICENSE = GPL-2.0
-11: FOO_LICENSE_FILES = COPYING
-12:
-13: $(eval $(kernel-module))
-14: $(eval $(generic-package))
-
-Lines 7-11 define the usual meta-data to specify the version, archive
-name, remote URI where to find the package source, licensing
-information.
-
-On line 13, we invoke the kernel-module helper infrastructure, that
-generates all the appropriate Makefile rules and variables to build
-that kernel module.
-
-Finally, on line 14, we invoke the generic-package infrastructure.
-
-The dependency on linux is automatically added, so it is not needed
-to specify it in FOO_DEPENDENCIES.
-
-What you may have noticed is that, unlike other package
-infrastructures, we explicitly invoke a second infrastructure. This
-allows a package to build a kernel module, but also, if needed, use
-any one of other package infrastructures to build normal userland
-components (libraries, executables). Using the kernel-module
-infrastructure on its own is not sufficient; another package
-infrastructure must be used.
-
-Lets look at a more complex example:
-
-01: ################################################################################
-02: #
-03: # foo
-04: #
-05: ################################################################################
-06:
-07: FOO_VERSION = 1.2.3
-08: FOO_SOURCE = foo-$(FOO_VERSION).tar.xz
-09: FOO_SITE = http://www.foosoftware.org/download
-10: FOO_LICENSE = GPL-2.0
-11: FOO_LICENSE_FILES = COPYING
-12:
-13: FOO_MODULE_SUBDIRS = driver/base
-14: FOO_MODULE_MAKE_OPTS = KVERSION=$(LINUX_VERSION_PROBED)
-15:
-16: ifeq ($(BR2_PACKAGE_LIBBAR),y)
-17: FOO_DEPENDENCIES = libbar
-18: FOO_CONF_OPTS = --enable-bar
-19: FOO_MODULE_SUBDIRS += driver/bar
-20: else
-21: FOO_CONF_OPTS = --disable-bar
-22: endif
-23:
-24: $(eval $(kernel-module))
-26: $(eval $(autotools-package))
-
-Here, we see that we have an autotools-based package, that also
-builds the kernel module located in sub-directory driver/base and, if
-libbar is enabled, the kernel module located in sub-directory driver/
-bar, and defines the variable KVERSION to be passed to the Linux
-buildsystem when building the module(s).
-
-18.19.2.kernel-module reference
-
-The main macro for the kernel module infrastructure is kernel-module.
-Unlike other package infrastructures, it is not stand-alone, and
-requires any of the other *-package macros be called after it.
-
-The kernel-module macro defines post-build and post-target-install
-hooks to build the kernel modules. If the packages .mk needs access
-to the built kernel modules, it should do so in a post-build hook, 
-registered after the call to kernel-module. Similarly, if the
-packages .mk needs access to the kernel module after it has been
-installed, it should do so in a post-install hook, registered after
-the call to kernel-module. Heres an example:
-
-$(eval $(kernel-module))
-
-define FOO_DO_STUFF_WITH_KERNEL_MODULE
-    # Do something with it...
-endef
-FOO_POST_BUILD_HOOKS += FOO_DO_STUFF_WITH_KERNEL_MODULE
-
-$(eval $(generic-package))
-
-Finally, unlike the other package infrastructures, there is no
-host-kernel-module variant to build a host kernel module.
-
-The following additional variables can optionally be defined to
-further configure the build of the kernel module:
-
-  * FOO_MODULE_SUBDIRS may be set to one or more sub-directories
-    (relative to the package source top-directory) where the kernel
-    module sources are. If empty or not set, the sources for the
-    kernel module(s) are considered to be located at the top of the
-    package source tree.
-  * FOO_MODULE_MAKE_OPTS may be set to contain extra variable
-    definitions to pass to the Linux buildsystem.
-
-You may also reference (but you may not set!) those variables:
-
-  * LINUX_DIR contains the path to where the Linux kernel has been
-    extracted and built.
-  * LINUX_VERSION contains the version string as configured by the
-    user.
-  * LINUX_VERSION_PROBED contains the real version string of the
-    kernel, retrieved with running make -C $(LINUX_DIR) kernelrelease
-  * KERNEL_ARCH contains the name of the current architecture, like
-    arm, mips
-
-18.20.Infrastructure for asciidoc documents
-
-The Buildroot manual, which you are currently reading, is entirely
-written using the AsciiDoc [http://asciidoc.org/] mark-up syntax. The
-manual is then rendered to many formats:
-
-  * html
-  * split-html
-  * pdf
-  * epub
-  * text
-
-Although Buildroot only contains one document written in AsciiDoc,
-there is, as for packages, an infrastructure for rendering documents
-using the AsciiDoc syntax.
-
-Also as for packages, the AsciiDoc infrastructure is available from a
-br2-external tree. This allows documentation for a br2-external tree
-to match the Buildroot documentation, as it will be rendered to the
-same formats and use the same layout and theme.
-
-18.20.1.asciidoc-document tutorial
-
-Whereas package infrastructures are suffixed with -package, the
-document infrastructures are suffixed with -document. So, the
-AsciiDoc infrastructure is named asciidoc-document.
-
-Here is an example to render a simple AsciiDoc document.
-
-01: ################################################################################
-02: #
-03: # foo-document
-04: #
-05: ################################################################################
-06:
-07: FOO_SOURCES = $(sort $(wildcard $(pkgdir)/*))
-08: $(eval $(call asciidoc-document))
-
-On line 7, the Makefile declares what the sources of the document
-are. Currently, it is expected that the documents sources are only
-local; Buildroot will not attempt to download anything to render a
-document. Thus, you must indicate where the sources are. Usually, the
-string above is sufficient for a document with no sub-directory
-structure.
-
-On line 8, we call the asciidoc-document function, which generates
-all the Makefile code necessary to render the document.
-
-18.20.2.asciidoc-document reference
-
-The list of variables that can be set in a .mk file to give metadata
-information is (assuming the document name is foo) :
-
-  * FOO_SOURCES, mandatory, defines the source files for the
-    document.
-  * FOO_RESOURCES, optional, may contain a space-separated list of
-    paths to one or more directories containing so-called resources
-    (like CSS or images). By default, empty.
-  * FOO_DEPENDENCIES, optional, the list of packages (most probably,
-    host-packages) that must be built before building this document.
-
-There are also additional hooks (see Section18.22, Hooks available
-in the various build steps for general information on hooks), that a
-document may set to define extra actions to be done at various steps:
-
-  * FOO_POST_RSYNC_HOOKS to run additional commands after the sources
-    have been copied by Buildroot. This can for example be used to
-    generate part of the manual with information extracted from the
-    tree. As an example, Buildroot uses this hook to generate the
-    tables in the appendices.
-  * FOO_CHECK_DEPENDENCIES_HOOKS to run additional tests on required
-    components to generate the document. In AsciiDoc, it is possible
-    to call filters, that is, programs that will parse an AsciiDoc
-    block and render it appropriately (e.g. ditaa [http://
-    ditaa.sourceforge.net/] or aafigure [https://pythonhosted.org/
-    aafigure/]).
-  * FOO_CHECK_DEPENDENCIES_<FMT>_HOOKS, to run additional tests for
-    the specified format <FMT> (see the list of rendered formats,
-    above).
-
-Here is a complete example that uses all variables and all hooks:
-
-01: ################################################################################

-18.21.Infrastructure specific to the Linux kernel package
-
-The Linux kernel package can use some specific infrastructures based
-on package hooks for building Linux kernel tools or/and building
-Linux kernel extensions.
-
-18.21.1.linux-kernel-tools
-
-Buildroot offers a helper infrastructure to build some userspace
-tools for the target available within the Linux kernel sources. Since
-their source code is part of the kernel source code, a special
-package, linux-tools, exists and re-uses the sources of the Linux
-kernel that runs on the target.
-
-Lets look at an example of a Linux tool. For a new Linux tool named
-foo, create a new menu entry in the existing package/linux-tools/
-Config.in. This file will contain the option descriptions related to
-each kernel tool that will be used and displayed in the configuration
-tool. It would basically look like:
-
-01: config BR2_PACKAGE_LINUX_TOOLS_FOO
-02:     bool "foo"
-03:     select BR2_PACKAGE_LINUX_TOOLS
-04:     help
-05:       This is a comment that explains what foo kernel tool is.
-06:
-07:       http://foosoftware.org/foo/
-
-The name of the option starts with the prefix
-BR2_PACKAGE_LINUX_TOOLS_, followed by the uppercase name of the tool
-(like is done for packages).
-
-Note.Unlike other packages, the linux-tools package options appear
-in the linux kernel menu, under the Linux Kernel Tools sub-menu, not
-under the Target packages main menu.
-
-Then for each linux tool, add a new .mk.in file named package/
-linux-tools/linux-tool-foo.mk.in. It would basically look like:
-
-01: ################################################################################
-02: #
-03: # foo
-04: #
-05: ################################################################################
-06:
-07: LINUX_TOOLS += foo
-08:
-09: FOO_DEPENDENCIES = libbbb
-10:
-11: define FOO_BUILD_CMDS
-12:     $(TARGET_MAKE_ENV) $(MAKE) -C $(LINUX_DIR)/tools foo
-13: endef
-14:
-15: define FOO_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS
-16:     $(TARGET_MAKE_ENV) $(MAKE) -C $(LINUX_DIR)/tools \
-17:             DESTDIR=$(STAGING_DIR) \
-18:             foo_install
-19: endef
-20:
-21: define FOO_INSTALL_TARGET_CMDS
-22:     $(TARGET_MAKE_ENV) $(MAKE) -C $(LINUX_DIR)/tools \
-23:             DESTDIR=$(TARGET_DIR) \
-24:             foo_install
-25: endef
-
-On line 7, we register the Linux tool foo to the list of available
-Linux tools.
-
-On line 9, we specify the list of dependencies this tool relies on.
-These dependencies are added to the Linux package dependencies list
-only when the foo tool is selected.
-
-The rest of the Makefile, lines 11-25 defines what should be done at
-the different steps of the Linux tool build process like for a
-generic package. They will actually be used only when the foo tool is
-selected. The only supported commands are _BUILD_CMDS,
-_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS and _INSTALL_TARGET_CMDS.
-
-Note.One must not call $(eval $(generic-package)) or any other
-package infrastructure! Linux tools are not packages by themselves,
-they are part of the linux-tools package.
-
-18.21.2.linux-kernel-extensions
-
-Some packages provide new features that require the Linux kernel tree
-to be modified. This can be in the form of patches to be applied on
-the kernel tree, or in the form of new files to be added to the tree.
-The Buildroots Linux kernel extensions infrastructure provides a
-simple solution to automatically do this, just after the kernel
-sources are extracted and before the kernel patches are applied.
-Examples of extensions packaged using this mechanism are the
-real-time extensions Xenomai and RTAI, as well as the set of
-out-of-tree LCD screens drivers fbtft.
-
-Lets look at an example on how to add a new Linux extension foo.
-
-First, create the package foo that provides the extension: this
-package is a standard package; see the previous chapters on how to
-create such a package. This package is in charge of downloading the
-sources archive, checking the hash, defining the licence informations
-and building user space tools if any.
-
-Then create the Linux extension proper: create a new menu entry in
-the existing linux/Config.ext.in. This file contains the option
-descriptions related to each kernel extension that will be used and
-displayed in the configuration tool. It would basically look like:
-
-01: config BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_EXT_FOO
-02:     bool "foo"
-03:     help
-04:       This is a comment that explains what foo kernel extension is.
-05:
-06:       http://foosoftware.org/foo/
-
-Then for each linux extension, add a new .mk file named linux/
-linux-ext-foo.mk. It should basically contain:
-
-01: ################################################################################
-02: #
-03: # foo
-04: #
-05: ################################################################################
-06:
-07: LINUX_EXTENSIONS += foo
-08:
-09: define FOO_PREPARE_KERNEL
-10:     $(FOO_DIR)/prepare-kernel-tree.sh --linux-dir=$(@D)
-11: endef
-
-On line 7, we add the Linux extension foo to the list of available
-Linux extensions.
-
-On line 9-11, we define what should be done by the extension to
-modify the Linux kernel tree; this is specific to the linux extension
-and can use the variables defined by the foo package, like: $
-(FOO_DIR) or $(FOO_VERSION) as well as all the Linux variables,
-like: $(LINUX_VERSION) or $(LINUX_VERSION_PROBED), $(KERNEL_ARCH)
-See the definition of those kernel variables.
-
-18.22.Hooks available in the various build steps
-
-The generic infrastructure (and as a result also the derived
-autotools and cmake infrastructures) allow packages to specify hooks.
-These define further actions to perform after existing steps. Most
-hooks arent really useful for generic packages, since the .mk file
-already has full control over the actions performed in each step of
-the package construction.
-
-The following hook points are available:
-
-  * LIBFOO_PRE_DOWNLOAD_HOOKS
-  * LIBFOO_POST_DOWNLOAD_HOOKS
-  * LIBFOO_PRE_EXTRACT_HOOKS
-  * LIBFOO_POST_EXTRACT_HOOKS
-  * LIBFOO_PRE_RSYNC_HOOKS
-  * LIBFOO_POST_RSYNC_HOOKS
-  * LIBFOO_PRE_PATCH_HOOKS
-  * LIBFOO_POST_PATCH_HOOKS
-  * LIBFOO_PRE_CONFIGURE_HOOKS
-  * LIBFOO_POST_CONFIGURE_HOOKS
-  * LIBFOO_PRE_BUILD_HOOKS
-  * LIBFOO_POST_BUILD_HOOKS
-  * LIBFOO_PRE_INSTALL_HOOKS (for host packages only)
-  * LIBFOO_POST_INSTALL_HOOKS (for host packages only)
-  * LIBFOO_PRE_INSTALL_STAGING_HOOKS (for target packages only)
-  * LIBFOO_POST_INSTALL_STAGING_HOOKS (for target packages only)
-  * LIBFOO_PRE_INSTALL_TARGET_HOOKS (for target packages only)
-  * LIBFOO_POST_INSTALL_TARGET_HOOKS (for target packages only)
-  * LIBFOO_PRE_INSTALL_IMAGES_HOOKS
-  * LIBFOO_POST_INSTALL_IMAGES_HOOKS
-  * LIBFOO_PRE_LEGAL_INFO_HOOKS
-  * LIBFOO_POST_LEGAL_INFO_HOOKS
-
-These variables are lists of variable names containing actions to be
-performed at this hook point. This allows several hooks to be
-registered at a given hook point. Here is an example:
-
-define LIBFOO_POST_PATCH_FIXUP
-        action1
-        action2
-endef
-
-LIBFOO_POST_PATCH_HOOKS += LIBFOO_POST_PATCH_FIXUP
-
-18.22.1.Using the POST_RSYNC hook
-
-The POST_RSYNC hook is run only for packages that use a local source,
-either through the local site method or the OVERRIDE_SRCDIR
-mechanism. In this case, package sources are copied using rsync from
-the local location into the buildroot build directory. The rsync
-command does not copy all files from the source directory, though.
-Files belonging to a version control system, like the directories
-.git, .hg, etc. are not copied. For most packages this is sufficient,
-but a given package can perform additional actions using the
-POST_RSYNC hook.
-
-In principle, the hook can contain any command you want. One specific
-use case, though, is the intentional copying of the version control
-directory using rsync. The rsync command you use in the hook can,
-among others, use the following variables:
-
-  * $(SRCDIR): the path to the overridden source directory
-  * $(@D): the path to the build directory
-
-18.22.2.Target-finalize hook
-
-Packages may also register hooks in LIBFOO_TARGET_FINALIZE_HOOKS.
-These hooks are run after all packages are built, but before the
-filesystem images are generated. They are seldom used, and your
-package probably do not need them.
-
-18.23.Gettext integration and interaction with packages
-
-Many packages that support internationalization use the gettext
-library. Dependencies for this library are fairly complicated and
-therefore, deserve some explanation.
-
-The glibc C library integrates a full-blown implementation of gettext
-, supporting translation. Native Language Support is therefore
-built-in in glibc.
-
-On the other hand, the uClibc and musl C libraries only provide a
-stub implementation of the gettext functionality, which allows to
-compile libraries and programs using gettext functions, but without
-providing the translation capabilities of a full-blown gettext
-implementation. With such C libraries, if real Native Language
-Support is necessary, it can be provided by the libintl library of
-the gettext package.
-
-Due to this, and in order to make sure that Native Language Support
-is properly handled, packages in Buildroot that can use NLS support
-should:
-
- 1. Ensure NLS support is enabled when BR2_SYSTEM_ENABLE_NLS=y. This
-    is done automatically for autotools packages and therefore should
-    only be done for packages using other package infrastructures.
- 2. Add $(TARGET_NLS_DEPENDENCIES) to the package <pkg>_DEPENDENCIES
-    variable. This addition should be done unconditionally: the value
-    of this variable is automatically adjusted by the core
-    infrastructure to contain the relevant list of packages. If NLS
-    support is disabled, this variable is empty. If NLS support is
-    enabled, this variable contains host-gettext so that tools needed
-    to compile translation files are available on the host. In
-    addition, if uClibc or musl are used, this variable also contains
-    gettext in order to get the full-blown gettext implementation.
- 3. If needed, add $(TARGET_NLS_LIBS) to the linker flags, so that
-    the package gets linked with libintl. This is generally not
-    needed with autotools packages as they usually detect
-    automatically that they should link with libintl. However,
-    packages using other build systems, or problematic
-    autotools-based packages may need this. $(TARGET_NLS_LIBS) should
-    be added unconditionally to the linker flags, as the core
-    automatically makes it empty or defined to -lintl depending on
-    the configuration.
-
-No changes should be made to the Config.in file to support NLS.
-
-Finally, certain packages need some gettext utilities on the target,
-such as the gettext program itself, which allows to retrieve
-translated strings, from the command line. In such a case, the
-package should:
-
-  * use select BR2_PACKAGE_GETTEXT in their Config.in file,
-    indicating in a comment above that its a runtime dependency
-    only.
-  * not add any gettext dependency in the DEPENDENCIES variable of
-    their .mk file.
-
-18.24.Tips and tricks
-
-18.24.1.Package name, config entry name and makefile variable
-relationship
-
-In Buildroot, there is some relationship between:
-
-  * the package name, which is the package directory name (and the
-    name of the *.mk file);
-  * the config entry name that is declared in the Config.in file;
-  * the makefile variable prefix.
-
-It is mandatory to maintain consistency between these elements, using
-the following rules:
-
-  * the package directory and the *.mk name are the package name
-    itself (e.g.: package/foo-bar_boo/foo-bar_boo.mk);
-  * the make target name is the package name itself (e.g.:
-    foo-bar_boo);
-  * the config entry is the upper case package name with . and -
-    characters substituted with _, prefixed with BR2_PACKAGE_ (e.g.:
-    BR2_PACKAGE_FOO_BAR_BOO);
-  * the *.mk file variable prefix is the upper case package name with
-    . and - characters substituted with _ (e.g.:
-    FOO_BAR_BOO_VERSION).
-
-18.24.2.How to check the coding style
-
-Buildroot provides a script in utils/check-package that checks new or
-changed files for coding style. It is not a complete language
-validator, but it catches many common mistakes. It is meant to run in
-the actual files you created or modified, before creating the patch
-for submission.
-
-This script can be used for packages, filesystem makefiles, Config.in
-files, etc. It does not check the files defining the package
-infrastructures and some other files containing similar common code.
-
-To use it, run the check-package script, by telling which files you
-created or changed:
-
-$ ./utils/check-package package/new-package/*
-
-If you have the utils directory in your path you can also run:
-
-$ cd package/new-package/
-$ check-package *
-
-The tool can also be used for packages in a br2-external:
-
-$ check-package -b /path/to/br2-ext-tree/package/my-package/*
-
-18.24.3.How to test your package
-
-Once you have added your new package, it is important that you test
-it under various conditions: does it build for all architectures?
-Does it build with the different C libraries? Does it need threads,
-NPTL? And so on
-
-Buildroot runs autobuilders [http://autobuild.buildroot.org/] which
-continuously test random configurations. However, these only build
-the master branch of the git tree, and your new fancy package is not
-yet there.
-
-Buildroot provides a script in utils/test-pkg that uses the same base
-configurations as used by the autobuilders so you can test your
-package in the same conditions.
-
-First, create a config snippet that contains all the necessary
-options needed to enable your package, but without any architecture
-or toolchain option. For example, lets create a config snippet that
-just enables libcurl, without any TLS backend:
-
-$ cat libcurl.config
-BR2_PACKAGE_LIBCURL=y
-
-If your package needs more configuration options, you can add them to
-the config snippet. For example, heres how you would test libcurl
-with openssl as a TLS backend and the curl program:
-
-$ cat libcurl.config
-BR2_PACKAGE_LIBCURL=y
-BR2_PACKAGE_LIBCURL_CURL=y
-BR2_PACKAGE_OPENSSL=y
-
-Then run the test-pkg script, by telling it what config snippet to
-use and what package to test:
-
-$ ./utils/test-pkg -c libcurl.config -p libcurl
-
-By default, test-pkg will build your package against a subset of the
-toolchains used by the autobuilders, which has been selected by the
-Buildroot developers as being the most useful and representative
-subset. If you want to test all toolchains, pass the -a option. Note
-that in any case, internal toolchains are excluded as they take too
-long to build.
-
-The output lists all toolchains that are tested and the corresponding
-result (excerpt, results are fake):
-
-$ ./utils/test-pkg -c libcurl.config -p libcurl
-                armv5-ctng-linux-gnueabi [ 1/11]: OK
-              armv7-ctng-linux-gnueabihf [ 2/11]: OK
-                        br-aarch64-glibc [ 3/11]: SKIPPED
-                           br-arcle-hs38 [ 4/11]: SKIPPED
-                            br-arm-basic [ 5/11]: FAILED
-                  br-arm-cortex-a9-glibc [ 6/11]: OK
-                   br-arm-cortex-a9-musl [ 7/11]: FAILED
-                   br-arm-cortex-m4-full [ 8/11]: OK
-                             br-arm-full [ 9/11]: OK
-                    br-arm-full-nothread [10/11]: FAILED
-                      br-arm-full-static [11/11]: OK
-11 builds, 2 skipped, 2 build failed, 1 legal-info failed
-
-The results mean:
-
-  * OK: the build was successful.
-  * SKIPPED: one or more configuration options listed in the config
-    snippet were not present in the final configuration. This is due
-    to options having dependencies not satisfied by the toolchain,
-    such as for example a package that depends on BR2_USE_MMU with a
-    noMMU toolchain. The missing options are reported in
-    missing.config in the output build directory (~/br-test-pkg/
-    TOOLCHAIN_NAME/ by default).
-  * FAILED: the build failed. Inspect the logfile file in the output
-    build directory to see what went wrong:
-
-      + the actual build failed,
-      + the legal-info failed,
-      + one of the preliminary steps (downloading the config file,
-        applying the configuration, running dirclean for the package)
-        failed.
-
-When there are failures, you can just re-run the script with the same
-options (after you fixed your package); the script will attempt to
-re-build the package specified with -p for all toolchains, without
-the need to re-build all the dependencies of that package.
-
-The test-pkg script accepts a few options, for which you can get some
-help by running:
-
-$ ./utils/test-pkg -h
-
-18.24.4.How to add a package from GitHub
-
-Packages on GitHub often dont have a download area with release
-tarballs. However, it is possible to download tarballs directly from
-the repository on GitHub. As GitHub is known to have changed download
-mechanisms in the past, the github helper function should be used as
-shown below.
-
-# Use a tag or a full commit ID
-FOO_VERSION = 1.0
-FOO_SITE = $(call github,<user>,<package>,v$(FOO_VERSION))
-
-Notes
-
-  * The FOO_VERSION can either be a tag or a commit ID.
-  * The tarball name generated by github matches the default one from
-    Buildroot (e.g.:
-    foo-f6fb6654af62045239caed5950bc6c7971965e60.tar.gz), so it is
-    not necessary to specify it in the .mk file.
-  * When using a commit ID as version, you should use the full 40 hex
-    characters.
-  * When the tag contains a prefix such as v in v1.0, then the
-    VERSION variable should contain just 1.0, and the v should be
-    added directly in the SITE variable, as illustrated above. This
-    ensures that the VERSION variable value can be used to match
-    against release-monitoring.org [http://www.release-monitoring.org
-    /] results.
-
-If the package you wish to add does have a release section on GitHub,
-the maintainer may have uploaded a release tarball, or the release
-may just point to the automatically generated tarball from the git
-tag. If there is a release tarball uploaded by the maintainer, we
-prefer to use that since it may be slightly different (e.g. it
-contains a configure script so we dont need to do AUTORECONF).
-
-You can see on the release page if its an uploaded tarball or a git
-tag:
-
-  * If it looks like the image above then it was uploaded by the
-    maintainer and you should use that link (in that example: 
-    mongrel2-v1.9.2.tar.bz2) to specify FOO_SITE, and not use the 
-    github helper.
-  * On the other hand, if theres is only the "Source code" link,
-    then its an automatically generated tarball and you should use
-    the github helper function.
-
-18.24.5.How to add a package from Gitlab
-
-In a similar way to the github macro described in Section18.24.4,
-How to add a package from GitHub, Buildroot also provides the
-gitlab macro to download from Gitlab repositories. It can be used to
-download auto-generated tarballs produced by Gitlab, either for
-specific tags or commits:
-
-# Use a tag or a full commit ID
-FOO_VERSION = 1.0
-FOO_SITE = $(call gitlab,<user>,<package>,v$(FOO_VERSION))
-
-By default, it will use a .tar.gz tarball, but Gitlab also provides
-.tar.bz2 tarballs, so by adding a <pkg>_SOURCE variable, this
-.tar.bz2 tarball can be used:
-
-# Use a tag or a full commit ID
-FOO_VERSION = 1.0
-FOO_SITE = $(call gitlab,<user>,<package>,v$(FOO_VERSION))
-FOO_SOURCE = foo-$(FOO_VERSION).tar.bz2
-
-If there is a specific tarball uploaded by the upstream developers in
-https://gitlab.com/<project>/releases/, do not use this macro, but
-rather use directly the link to the tarball.
-
-18.25.Conclusion
-
-As you can see, adding a software package to Buildroot is simply a
-matter of writing a Makefile using an existing example and modifying
-it according to the compilation process required by the package.
-
-If you package software that might be useful for other people, dont
-forget to send a patch to the Buildroot mailing list (see
-Section22.5, Submitting patches)!
-
-Chapter19.Patching a package
-
-While integrating a new package or updating an existing one, it may
-be necessary to patch the source of the software to get it
-cross-built within Buildroot.
-
-Buildroot offers an infrastructure to automatically handle this
-during the builds. It supports three ways of applying patch sets:
-downloaded patches, patches supplied within buildroot and patches
-located in a user-defined global patch directory.
-
-19.1.Providing patches
-
-19.1.1.Downloaded
-
-If it is necessary to apply a patch that is available for download,
-then add it to the <packagename>_PATCH variable. If an entry contains
-://, then Buildroot will assume it is a full URL and download the
-patch from this location. Otherwise, Buildroot will assume that the
-patch should be downloaded from <packagename>_SITE. It can be a
-single patch, or a tarball containing a patch series.
-
-Like for all downloads, a hash should be added to the
-<packagename>.hash file.
-
-This method is typically used for packages from Debian.
-
-19.1.2.Within Buildroot
-
-Most patches are provided within Buildroot, in the package directory;
-these typically aim to fix cross-compilation, libc support, or other
-such issues.
-
-These patch files should be named <number>-<description>.patch.
-
-Notes
-
-  * The patch files coming with Buildroot should not contain any
-    package version reference in their filename.
-  * The field <number> in the patch file name refers to the apply
-    order, and shall start at 1; It is preferred to pad the number
-    with zeros up to 4 digits, like git-format-patch does. E.g.:
-    0001-foobar-the-buz.patch
-  * Previously, it was mandatory for patches to be prefixed with the
-    name of the package, like <package>-<number>-<description>.patch,
-    but that is no longer the case. Existing packages will be fixed
-    as time passes. Do not prefix patches with the package name.
-  * Previously, a series file, as used by quilt, could also be added
-    in the package directory. In that case, the series file defines
-    the patch application order. This is deprecated, and will be
-    removed in the future. Do not use a series file.
-
-19.1.3.Global patch directory
-
-The BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR configuration file option can be used to
-specify a space separated list of one or more directories containing
-global package patches. See Section9.8, Adding project-specific
-patches for details.
-
-19.2.How patches are applied
-
- 1. Run the <packagename>_PRE_PATCH_HOOKS commands if defined;
- 2. Cleanup the build directory, removing any existing *.rej files;
- 3. If <packagename>_PATCH is defined, then patches from these
-    tarballs are applied;
- 4. If there are some *.patch files in the packages Buildroot
-    directory or in a package subdirectory named <packageversion>,
-    then:
-
-      + If a series file exists in the package directory, then
-        patches are applied according to the series file;
-      + Otherwise, patch files matching *.patch are applied in
-        alphabetical order. So, to ensure they are applied in the
-        right order, it is highly recommended to name the patch files
-        like this: <number>-<description>.patch, where <number>
-        refers to the apply order.
- 5. If BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR is defined, the directories will be
-    enumerated in the order they are specified. The patches are
-    applied as described in the previous step.
- 6. Run the <packagename>_POST_PATCH_HOOKS commands if defined.
-
-If something goes wrong in the steps 3 or 4, then the build fails.
-
-19.3.Format and licensing of the package patches
-
-Patches are released under the same license as the software they
-apply to (see Section13.2, Complying with the Buildroot license).
-
-A message explaining what the patch does, and why it is needed,
-should be added in the header commentary of the patch.
-
-You should add a Signed-off-by statement in the header of the each
-patch to help with keeping track of the changes and to certify that
-the patch is released under the same license as the software that is
-modified.
-
-If the software is under version control, it is recommended to use
-the upstream SCM software to generate the patch set.
-
-Otherwise, concatenate the header with the output of the diff -purN
-package-version.orig/ package-version/ command.
-
-If you update an existing patch (e.g. when bumping the package
-version), make sure the existing From header and Signed-off-by tags
-are not removed, but do update the rest of the patch comment when
-appropriate.
-
-At the end, the patch should look like:
-
-configure.ac: add C++ support test
-
-Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@noname.org>
-
---- configure.ac.orig
-+++ configure.ac
-@@ -40,2 +40,12 @@

-
-19.4.Integrating patches found on the Web
-
-When integrating a patch of which you are not the author, you have to
-add a few things in the header of the patch itself.
-
-Depending on whether the patch has been obtained from the project
-repository itself, or from somewhere on the web, add one of the
-following tags:
-
-Backported from: <some commit id>
-
-or
-
-Fetch from: <some url>
-
-It is also sensible to add a few words about any changes to the patch
-that may have been necessary.

-TODO
-
-Chapter21.Debugging Buildroot
-
-It is possible to instrument the steps Buildroot does when building
-packages. Define the variable BR2_INSTRUMENTATION_SCRIPTS to contain
-the path of one or more scripts (or other executables), in a
-space-separated list, you want called before and after each step. The
-scripts are called in sequence, with three parameters:
-
-  * start or end to denote the start (resp. the end) of a step;
-  * the name of the step about to be started, or which just ended;
-  * the name of the package.
-
-For example :
-
-make BR2_INSTRUMENTATION_SCRIPTS="/path/to/my/script1 /path/to/my/script2"
-
-The list of steps is:
-
-  * extract
-  * patch
-  * configure
-  * build
-  * install-host, when a host-package is installed in $(HOST_DIR)
-  * install-target, when a target-package is installed in $
-    (TARGET_DIR)
-  * install-staging, when a target-package is installed in $
-    (STAGING_DIR)
-  * install-image, when a target-package installs files in $
-    (BINARIES_DIR)
-
-The script has access to the following variables:
-
-  * BR2_CONFIG: the path to the Buildroot .config file
-  * HOST_DIR, STAGING_DIR, TARGET_DIR: see Section18.5.2,
-    generic-package reference
-  * BUILD_DIR: the directory where packages are extracted and built
-  * BINARIES_DIR: the place where all binary files (aka images) are
-    stored
-  * BASE_DIR: the base output directory
-
-Chapter22.Contributing to Buildroot
-
-There are many ways in which you can contribute to Buildroot:
-analyzing and fixing bugs, analyzing and fixing package build
-failures detected by the autobuilders, testing and reviewing patches
-sent by other developers, working on the items in our TODO list and
-sending your own improvements to Buildroot or its manual. The
-following sections give a little more detail on each of these items.
-
-If you are interested in contributing to Buildroot, the first thing
-you should do is to subscribe to the Buildroot mailing list. This
-list is the main way of interacting with other Buildroot developers
-and to send contributions to. If you arent subscribed yet, then
-refer to Chapter5, Community resources for the subscription link.
-
-If you are going to touch the code, it is highly recommended to use a
-git repository of Buildroot, rather than starting from an extracted
-source code tarball. Git is the easiest way to develop from and
-directly send your patches to the mailing list. Refer to Chapter3, 
-Getting Buildroot for more information on obtaining a Buildroot git
-tree.
-
-22.1.Reproducing, analyzing and fixing bugs
-
-A first way of contributing is to have a look at the open bug reports
-in the Buildroot bug tracker [https://bugs.buildroot.org/buglist.cgi?
-product=buildroot]. As we strive to keep the bug count as small as
-possible, all help in reproducing, analyzing and fixing reported bugs
-is more than welcome. Dont hesitate to add a comment to bug reports
-reporting your findings, even if you dont yet see the full picture.
-
-22.2.Analyzing and fixing autobuild failures
-
-The Buildroot autobuilders are a set of build machines that
-continuously run Buildroot builds based on random configurations.
-This is done for all architectures supported by Buildroot, with
-various toolchains, and with a random selection of packages. With the
-large commit activity on Buildroot, these autobuilders are a great
-help in detecting problems very early after commit.
-
-All build results are available at http://autobuild.buildroot.org,
-statistics are at http://autobuild.buildroot.org/stats.php. Every
-day, an overview of all failed packages is sent to the mailing list.
-
-Detecting problems is great, but obviously these problems have to be
-fixed as well. Your contribution is very welcome here! There are
-basically two things that can be done:
-
-  * Analyzing the problems. The daily summary mails do not contain
-    details about the actual failures: in order to see whats going
-    on you have to open the build log and check the last output.
-    Having someone doing this for all packages in the mail is very
-    useful for other developers, as they can make a quick initial
-    analysis based on this output alone.
-  * Fixing a problem. When fixing autobuild failures, you should
-    follow these steps:
-
-     1. Check if you can reproduce the problem by building with the
-        same configuration. You can do this manually, or use the
-        br-reproduce-build [http://git.buildroot.org/buildroot-test/
-        tree/utils/br-reproduce-build] script that will automatically
-        clone a Buildroot git repository, checkout the correct
-        revision, download and set the right configuration, and start
-        the build.
-     2. Analyze the problem and create a fix.
-     3. Verify that the problem is really fixed by starting from a
-        clean Buildroot tree and only applying your fix.
-     4. Send the fix to the Buildroot mailing list (see Section22.5,
-        Submitting patches). In case you created a patch against
-        the package sources, you should also send the patch upstream
-        so that the problem will be fixed in a later release, and the
-        patch in Buildroot can be removed. In the commit message of a
-        patch fixing an autobuild failure, add a reference to the
-        build result directory, as follows:
-
-Fixes: http://autobuild.buildroot.org/results/51000a9d4656afe9e0ea6f07b9f8ed374c2e4069
-
-22.3.Reviewing and testing patches
-
-With the amount of patches sent to the mailing list each day, the
-maintainer has a very hard job to judge which patches are ready to
-apply and which ones arent. Contributors can greatly help here by
-reviewing and testing these patches.
-
-In the review process, do not hesitate to respond to patch
-submissions for remarks, suggestions or anything that will help
-everyone to understand the patches and make them better. Please use
-internet style replies in plain text emails when responding to patch
-submissions.
-
-To indicate approval of a patch, there are three formal tags that
-keep track of this approval. To add your tag to a patch, reply to it
-with the approval tag below the original authors Signed-off-by line.
-These tags will be picked up automatically by patchwork (see
-Section22.3.1, Applying Patches from Patchwork) and will be part
-of the commit log when the patch is accepted.
-
-Tested-by
-    Indicates that the patch has been tested successfully. You are
-    encouraged to specify what kind of testing you performed
-    (compile-test on architecture X and Y, runtime test on target A,
-    ). This additional information helps other testers and the
-    maintainer.
-Reviewed-by
-    Indicates that you code-reviewed the patch and did your best in
-    spotting problems, but you are not sufficiently familiar with the
-    area touched to provide an Acked-by tag. This means that there
-    may be remaining problems in the patch that would be spotted by
-    someone with more experience in that area. Should such problems
-    be detected, your Reviewed-by tag remains appropriate and you
-    cannot be blamed.
-Acked-by
-    Indicates that you code-reviewed the patch and you are familiar
-    enough with the area touched to feel that the patch can be
-    committed as-is (no additional changes required). In case it
-    later turns out that something is wrong with the patch, your
-    Acked-by could be considered inappropriate. The difference
-    between Acked-by and Reviewed-by is thus mainly that you are
-    prepared to take the blame on Acked patches, but not on Reviewed
-    ones.
-
-If you reviewed a patch and have comments on it, you should simply
-reply to the patch stating these comments, without providing a
-Reviewed-by or Acked-by tag. These tags should only be provided if
-you judge the patch to be good as it is.
-
-It is important to note that neither Reviewed-by nor Acked-by imply
-that testing has been performed. To indicate that you both reviewed
-and tested the patch, provide two separate tags (Reviewed/Acked-by
-and Tested-by).
-
-Note also that any developer can provide Tested/Reviewed/Acked-by
-tags, without exception, and we encourage everyone to do this.
-Buildroot does not have a defined group of core developers, it just
-so happens that some developers are more active than others. The
-maintainer will value tags according to the track record of their
-submitter. Tags provided by a regular contributor will naturally be
-trusted more than tags provided by a newcomer. As you provide tags
-more regularly, your trustworthiness (in the eyes of the maintainer)
-will go up, but any tag provided is valuable.
-
-Buildroots Patchwork website can be used to pull in patches for
-testing purposes. Please see Section22.3.1, Applying Patches from
-Patchwork for more information on using Buildroots Patchwork
-website to apply patches.
-
-22.3.1.Applying Patches from Patchwork
-
-The main use of Buildroots Patchwork website for a developer is for
-pulling in patches into their local git repository for testing
-purposes.
-
-When browsing patches in the patchwork management interface, an mbox
-link is provided at the top of the page. Copy this link address and
-run the following commands:
-
-$ git checkout -b <test-branch-name>
-$ wget -O - <mbox-url> | git am
-
-Another option for applying patches is to create a bundle. A bundle
-is a set of patches that you can group together using the patchwork
-interface. Once the bundle is created and the bundle is made public,
-you can copy the mbox link for the bundle and apply the bundle using
-the above commands.
-
-22.4.Work on items from the TODO list
-
-If you want to contribute to Buildroot but dont know where to start,
-and you dont like any of the above topics, you can always work on
-items from the Buildroot TODO list [http://elinux.org/Buildroot#
-Todo_list]. Dont hesitate to discuss an item first on the mailing
-list or on IRC. Do edit the wiki to indicate when you start working
-on an item, so we avoid duplicate efforts.
-
-22.5.Submitting patches
-
-Note
-
-Please, do not attach patches to bugs, send them to the mailing list
-instead.
-
-If you made some changes to Buildroot and you would like to
-contribute them to the Buildroot project, proceed as follows.
-
-22.5.1.The formatting of a patch
-
-We expect patches to be formatted in a specific way. This is
-necessary to make it easy to review patches, to be able to apply them
-easily to the git repository, to make it easy to find back in the
-history how and why things have changed, and to make it possible to
-use git bisect to locate the origin of a problem.
-
-First of all, it is essential that the patch has a good commit
-message. The commit message should start with a separate line with a
-brief summary of the change, prefixed by the area touched by the
-patch. A few examples of good commit titles:
-
-  * package/linuxptp: bump version to 2.0
-  * configs/imx23evk: bump Linux version to 4.19
-  * package/pkg-generic: postpone evaluation of dependency conditions
-  * boot/uboot: needs host-{flex,bison}
-  * support/testing: add python-ubjson tests
-
-The description that follows the prefix should start with a lower
-case letter (i.e "bump", "needs", "postpone", "add" in the above
-examples).
-
-Second, the body of the commit message should describe why this
-change is needed, and if necessary also give details about how it was
-done. When writing the commit message, think of how the reviewers
-will read it, but also think about how you will read it when you look
-at this change again a few years down the line.
-
-Third, the patch itself should do only one change, but do it
-completely. Two unrelated or weakly related changes should usually be
-done in two separate patches. This usually means that a patch affects
-only a single package. If several changes are related, it is often
-still possible to split them up in small patches and apply them in a
-specific order. Small patches make it easier to review, and often
-make it easier to understand afterwards why a change was done.
-However, each patch must be complete. It is not allowed that the
-build is broken when only the first but not the second patch is
-applied. This is necessary to be able to use git bisect afterwards.
-
-Of course, while youre doing your development, youre probably going
-back and forth between packages, and certainly not committing things
-immediately in a way that is clean enough for submission. So most
-developers rewrite the history of commits to produce a clean set of
-commits that is appropriate for submission. To do this, you need to
-use interactive rebasing. You can learn about it in the Pro Git book
-[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History].
-Sometimes, it is even easier to discard you history with git reset
---soft origin/master and select individual changes with git add -i or
-git add -p.
-
-Finally, the patch should be signed off. This is done by adding
-Signed-off-by: Your Real Name <> at the end of the commit message.
-git commit -s does that for you, if configured properly. The
-Signed-off-by tag means that you publish the patch under the
-Buildroot license (i.e. GPL-2.0+, except for package patches, which
-have the upstream license), and that you are allowed to do so. See
-the Developer Certificate of Origin [http://developercertificate.org
-/] for details.
-
-When adding new packages, you should submit every package in a
-separate patch. This patch should have the update to package/
-Config.in, the package Config.in file, the .mk file, the .hash file,
-any init script, and all package patches. If the package has many
-sub-options, these are sometimes better added as separate follow-up
-patches. The summary line should be something like <packagename>: new
-package. The body of the commit message can be empty for simple
-packages, or it can contain the description of the package (like the
-Config.in help text). If anything special has to be done to build the
-package, this should also be explained explicitly in the commit
-message body.
-
-When you bump a package to a new version, you should also submit a
-separate patch for each package. Dont forget to update the .hash
-file, or add it if it doesnt exist yet. Also dont forget to check
-if the _LICENSE and _LICENSE_FILES are still valid. The summary line
-should be something like <packagename>: bump to version <new
-version>. If the new version only contains security updates compared
-to the existing one, the summary should be <packagename>: security
-bump to version <new version> and the commit message body should show
-the CVE numbers that are fixed. If some package patches can be
-removed in the new version, it should be explained explicitly why
-they can be removed, preferably with the upstream commit ID. Also any
-other required changes should be explained explicitly, like configure
-options that no longer exist or are no longer needed.
-
-If you are interested in getting notified of build failures and of
-further changes in the packages you added or modified, please add
-yourself to the DEVELOPERS file. This should be done in the same
-patch creating or modifying the package. See the DEVELOPERS file for
-more information.
-
-Buildroot provides a handy tool to check for common coding style
-mistakes on files you created or modified, called check-package (see
-Section18.24.2, How to check the coding style for more
-information).
-
-22.5.2.Preparing a patch series
-
-Starting from the changes committed in your local git view, rebase
-your development branch on top of the upstream tree before generating
-a patch set. To do so, run:
-
-$ git fetch --all --tags
-$ git rebase origin/master
-
-Now, you are ready to generate then submit your patch set.
-
-To generate it, run:
-
-$ git format-patch -M -n -s -o outgoing origin/master
-
-This will generate patch files in the outgoing subdirectory,
-automatically adding the Signed-off-by line.
-
-Once patch files are generated, you can review/edit the commit
-message before submitting them, using your favorite text editor.
-
-Buildroot provides a handy tool to know to whom your patches should
-be sent, called get-developers (see Chapter23, DEVELOPERS file and
-get-developers for more information). This tool reads your patches
-and outputs the appropriate git send-email command to use:
-
-$ ./utils/get-developers outgoing/*
-
-Use the output of get-developers to send your patches:
-
-$ git send-email --to buildroot@buildroot.org --cc bob --cc alice outgoing/*
-
-Alternatively, get-developers -e can be used directly with the
---cc-cmd argument to git send-email to automatically CC the affected
-developers:
-
-$ git send-email --to buildroot@buildroot.org \
-      --cc-cmd './utils/get-developers -e' origin/master
-
-git can be configured to automatically do this out of the box with:
-
-$ git config sendemail.to buildroot@buildroot.org
-$ git config sendemail.ccCmd "$(pwd)/utils/get-developers -e"
-
-And then just do:
-
-$ git send-email origin/master
-
-Note that git should be configured to use your mail account. To
-configure git, see man git-send-email or google it.
-
-If you do not use git send-email, make sure posted patches are not
-line-wrapped, otherwise they cannot easily be applied. In such a
-case, fix your e-mail client, or better yet, learn to use git
-send-email.
-
-22.5.3.Cover letter
-
-If you want to present the whole patch set in a separate mail, add
---cover-letter to the git format-patch command (see man
-git-format-patch for further information). This will generate a
-template for an introduction e-mail to your patch series.
-
-A cover letter may be useful to introduce the changes you propose in
-the following cases:
-
-  * large number of commits in the series;
-  * deep impact of the changes in the rest of the project;
-  * RFC ^[4];
-  * whenever you feel it will help presenting your work, your
-    choices, the review process, etc.
-
-22.5.4.Patches for maintenance branches
-
-When fixing bugs on a maintenance branch, bugs should be fixed on the
-master branch first. The commit log for such a patch may then contain
-a post-commit note specifying what branches are affected:
-
-package/foo: fix stuff
-
-Signed-off-by: Your Real Name <your@email.address>
----
-Backport to: 2020.02.x, 2020.05.x
-(2020.08.x not affected as the version was bumped)
-
-Those changes will then be backported by a maintainer to the affected
-branches.
-
-However, some bugs may apply only to a specific release, for example
-because it is using an older version of a package. In that case,
-patches should be based off the maintenance branch, and the patch
-subject prefix must include the maintenance branch name (for example
-"[PATCH 2020.02.x]"). This can be done with the git format-patch flag
---subject-prefix:
-
-$ git format-patch --subject-prefix "PATCH 2020.02.x" \
-    -M -s -o outgoing origin/2020.02.x
-
-Then send the patches with git send-email, as described above.
-
-22.5.5.Patch revision changelog
-
-When improvements are requested, the new revision of each commit
-should include a changelog of the modifications between each
-submission. Note that when your patch series is introduced by a cover
-letter, an overall changelog may be added to the cover letter in
-addition to the changelog in the individual commits. The best thing
-to rework a patch series is by interactive rebasing: git rebase -i
-origin/master. Consult the git manual for more information.
-
-When added to the individual commits, this changelog is added when
-editing the commit message. Below the Signed-off-by section, add ---
-and your changelog.
-
-Although the changelog will be visible for the reviewers in the mail
-thread, as well as in patchwork [http://patchwork.buildroot.org], git
-will automatically ignores lines below --- when the patch will be
-merged. This is the intended behavior: the changelog is not meant to
-be preserved forever in the git history of the project.
-
-Hereafter the recommended layout:
-
-Patch title: short explanation, max 72 chars
-
-A paragraph that explains the problem, and how it manifests itself. If
-the problem is complex, it is OK to add more paragraphs. All paragraphs
-should be wrapped at 72 characters.
-
-A paragraph that explains the root cause of the problem. Again, more
-than one paragraph is OK.
-
-Finally, one or more paragraphs that explain how the problem is solved.
-Don't hesitate to explain complex solutions in detail.
-
-Signed-off-by: John DOE <john.doe@example.net>

-Changes v2 -> v3:
-  - foo bar  (suggested by Jane)
-  - bar buz
-
-Changes v1 -> v2:
-  - alpha bravo  (suggested by John)
-  - charly delta
-
-Any patch revision should include the version number. The version
-number is simply composed of the letter v followed by an integer
-greater or equal to two (i.e. "PATCH v2", "PATCH v3" ).
-
-This can be easily handled with git format-patch by using the option
---subject-prefix:
-
-$ git format-patch --subject-prefix "PATCH v4" \
-    -M -s -o outgoing origin/master
-
-Since git version 1.8.1, you can also use -v <n> (where <n> is the
-version number):
-
-$ git format-patch -v4 -M -s -o outgoing origin/master
-
-When you provide a new version of a patch, please mark the old one as
-superseded in patchwork [http://patchwork.buildroot.org]. You need to
-create an account on patchwork [http://patchwork.buildroot.org] to be
-able to modify the status of your patches. Note that you can only
-change the status of patches you submitted yourself, which means the
-email address you register in patchwork [http://
-patchwork.buildroot.org] should match the one you use for sending
-patches to the mailing list.
-
-You can also add the --in-reply-to <message-id> option when
-submitting a patch to the mailing list. The id of the mail to reply
-to can be found under the "Message Id" tag on patchwork [http://
-patchwork.buildroot.org]. The advantage of in-reply-to is that
-patchwork will automatically mark the previous version of the patch
-as superseded.
-
-22.6.Reporting issues/bugs or getting help
-
-Before reporting any issue, please check in the mailing list archive
-whether someone has already reported and/or fixed a similar problem.
-
-However you choose to report bugs or get help, either by opening a
-bug in the bug tracker or by sending a mail to the mailing list,
-there are a number of details to provide in order to help people
-reproduce and find a solution to the issue.
-
-Try to think as if you were trying to help someone else; in that
-case, what would you need?
-
-Here is a short list of details to provide in such case:
-
-  * host machine (OS/release)
-  * version of Buildroot
-  * target for which the build fails
-  * package(s) for which the build fails
-  * the command that fails and its output
-  * any information you think that may be relevant
-
-Additionally, you should add the .config file (or if you know how, a
-defconfig; see Section9.3, Storing the Buildroot configuration).
-
-If some of these details are too large, do not hesitate to use a
-pastebin service. Note that not all available pastebin services will
-preserve Unix-style line terminators when downloading raw pastes.
-Following pastebin services are known to work correctly: - https://
-gist.github.com/ - http://code.bulix.org/
-
-22.7.Using the runtime tests framework
-
-Buildroot includes a run-time testing framework built upon Python
-scripting and QEMU runtime execution. The goals of the framework are
-the following:
-
-  * build a well defined Buildroot configuration
-  * optionally, verify some properties of the build output
-  * optionally, boot the build results under Qemu, and verify that a
-    given feature is working as expected
-
-The entry point to use the runtime tests framework is the support/
-testing/run-tests tool, which has a series of options documented in
-the tools help -h description. Some common options include setting
-the download folder, the output folder, keeping build output, and for
-multiple test cases, you can set the JLEVEL for each.
-
-Here is an example walk through of running a test case.
-
-  * For a first step, let us see what all the test case options are.
-    The test cases can be listed by executing support/testing/
-    run-tests -l. These tests can all be run individually during test
-    development from the console. Both one at a time and selectively
-    as a group of a subset of tests.
-
-$ support/testing/run-tests -l
-List of tests
-test_run (tests.utils.test_check_package.TestCheckPackage)
-test_run (tests.toolchain.test_external.TestExternalToolchainBuildrootMusl) ... ok
-test_run (tests.toolchain.test_external.TestExternalToolchainBuildrootuClibc) ... ok
-test_run (tests.toolchain.test_external.TestExternalToolchainCCache) ... ok

-test_run (tests.init.test_busybox.TestInitSystemBusyboxRwNet) ... ok
-
-Ran 157 tests in 0.021s
-
-OK
-
-  * Then, to run one test case:
-
-$ support/testing/run-tests -d dl -o output_folder -k tests.init.test_busybox.TestInitSystemBusyboxRw
-15:03:26 TestInitSystemBusyboxRw                  Starting
-15:03:28 TestInitSystemBusyboxRw                  Building
-15:08:18 TestInitSystemBusyboxRw                  Building done
-15:08:27 TestInitSystemBusyboxRw                  Cleaning up
-.
-Ran 1 test in 301.140s
-
-OK
-
-The standard output indicates if the test is successful or not. By
-default, the output folder for the test is deleted automatically
-unless the option -k is passed to keep the output directory.
-
-22.7.1.Creating a test case
-
-Within the Buildroot repository, the testing framework is organized
-at the top level in support/testing/ by folders of conf, infra and
-tests. All the test cases live under the tests folder and are
-organized in various folders representing the category of test.
-
-The best way to get familiar with how to create a test case is to
-look at a few of the basic file system support/testing/tests/fs/ and
-init support/testing/tests/init/ test scripts. Those tests give good
-examples of a basic tests that include both checking the build
-results, and doing runtime tests. There are other more advanced cases
-that use things like nested br2-external folders to provide skeletons
-and additional packages.
-
-Creating a basic test case involves:
-
-  * Defining a test class that inherits from infra.basetest.BRTest
-  * Defining the config member of the test class, to the Buildroot
-    configuration to build for this test case. It can optionally rely
-    on configuration snippets provided by the runtime test
-    infrastructure: infra.basetest.BASIC_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIG to get a
-    basic architecture/toolchain configuration, and
-    infra.basetest.MINIMAL_CONFIG to not build any filesystem. The
-    advantage of using infra.basetest.BASIC_TOOLCHAIN_CONFIG is that
-    a matching Linux kernel image is provided, which allows to boot
-    the resulting image in Qemu without having to build a Linux
-    kernel image as part of the test case, therefore significant
-    decreasing the build time required for the test case.
-  * Implementing a def test_run(self): function to implement the
-    actual tests to run after the build has completed. They may be
-    tests that verify the build output, by running command on the
-    host using the run_cmd_on_host() helper function. Or they may
-    boot the generated system in Qemu using the Emulator object
-    available as self.emulator in the test case. For example
-    self.emulator.boot() allows to boot the system in Qemu,
-    self.emulator.login() allows to login, self.emulator.run() allows
-    to run shell commands inside Qemu.
-
-After creating the test script, add yourself to the DEVELOPERS file
-to be the maintainer of that test case.
-
-22.7.2.Debugging a test case
-
-When a test case runs, the output_folder will contain the following:
-
-$ ls output_folder/
-TestInitSystemBusyboxRw/
-TestInitSystemBusyboxRw-build.log
-TestInitSystemBusyboxRw-run.log
-
-TestInitSystemBusyboxRw/ is the Buildroot output directory, and it is
-preserved only if the -k option is passed.
-
-TestInitSystemBusyboxRw-build.log is the log of the Buildroot build.
-
-TestInitSystemBusyboxRw-run.log is the log of the Qemu boot and test.
-This file will only exist if the build was successful and the test
-case involves booting under Qemu.
-
-If you want to manually run Qemu to do manual tests of the build
-result, the first few lines of TestInitSystemBusyboxRw-run.log
-contain the Qemu command line to use.
-
-You can also make modifications to the current sources inside the
-output_folder (e.g. for debug purposes) and rerun the standard
-Buildroot make targets (in order to regenerate the complete image
-with the new modifications) and then rerun the test.
-
-22.7.3.Runtime tests and Gitlab CI
-
-All runtime tests are regularly executed by Buildroot Gitlab CI
-infrastructure, see .gitlab.yml and https://gitlab.com/buildroot.org/
-buildroot/-/jobs.
-
-You can also use Gitlab CI to test your new test cases, or verify
-that existing tests continue to work after making changes in
-Buildroot.
-
-In order to achieve this, you need to create a fork of the Buildroot
-project on Gitlab, and be able to push branches to your Buildroot
-fork on Gitlab.
-
-The name of the branch that you push will determine if a Gitlab CI
-pipeline will be triggered or not, and for which test cases.
-
-In the examples below, the <name> component of the branch name is an
-arbitrary string you choose.
-
-  * To trigger all run-test test case jobs, push a branch that ends
-    with -runtime-tests:
-
- $ git push gitlab HEAD:<name>-runtime-tests
-
-  * To trigger one or several test case jobs, push a branch that ends
-    with the complete test case name
-    (tests.init.test_busybox.TestInitSystemBusyboxRo) or with the
-    name of a category of tests (tests.init.test_busybox):
-
- $ git push gitlab HEAD:<name>-<test case name>
-
-Example to run one test:
-
- $ git push gitlab HEAD:foo-tests.init.test_busybox.TestInitSystemBusyboxRo
-
-Examples to run several tests part of the same group:
-
- $ git push gitlab HEAD:foo-tests.init.test_busybox
- $ git push gitlab HEAD:foo-tests.init
-

-^[4] RFC: (Request for comments) change proposal
-
-Chapter23.DEVELOPERS file and get-developers
-
-The main Buildroot directory contains a file named DEVELOPERS that
-lists the developers involved with various areas of Buildroot. Thanks
-to this file, the get-developers tool allows to:
-
-  * Calculate the list of developers to whom patches should be sent,
-    by parsing the patches and matching the modified files with the
-    relevant developers. See Section22.5, Submitting patches for
-    details.
-  * Find which developers are taking care of a given architecture or
-    package, so that they can be notified when a build failure occurs
-    on this architecture or package. This is done in interaction with
-    Buildroots autobuild infrastructure.
-
-We ask developers adding new packages, new boards, or generally new
-functionality in Buildroot, to register themselves in the DEVELOPERS
-file. As an example, we expect a developer contributing a new package
-to include in his patch the appropriate modification to the
-DEVELOPERS file.
-
-The DEVELOPERS file format is documented in detail inside the file
-itself.
-
-The get-developers tool, located in utils/ allows to use the
-DEVELOPERS file for various tasks:
-
-  * When passing one or several patches as command line argument,
-    get-developers will return the appropriate git send-email
-    command. If the -e option is passed, only the email addresses are
-    printed in a format suitable for git send-email --cc-cmd.
-  * When using the -a <arch> command line option, get-developers will
-    return the list of developers in charge of the given
-    architecture.
-  * When using the -p <package> command line option, get-developers
-    will return the list of developers in charge of the given
-    package.
-  * When using the -c command line option, get-developers will look
-    at all files under version control in the Buildroot repository,
-    and list the ones that are not handled by any developer. The
-    purpose of this option is to help completing the DEVELOPERS file.
-  * When using without any arguments, it validates the integrity of
-    the DEVELOPERS file and will note WARNINGS for items that dont
-    match.
-
-Chapter24.Release Engineering
-
-24.1.Releases
-
-The Buildroot project makes quarterly releases with monthly bugfix
-releases. The first release of each year is a long term support
-release, LTS.
-
-  * Quarterly releases: 2020.02, 2020.05, 2020.08, and 2020.11
-  * Bugfix releases: 2020.02.1, 2020.02.2, 
-  * LTS releases: 2020.02, 2021.02, 
-
-Releases are supported until the first bugfix release of the next
-release, e.g., 2020.05.x is EOL when 2020.08.1 is released.
-
-LTS releases are supported until the first bugfix release of the next
-LTS, e.g., 2020.02.x is supported until 2021.02.1 is released.
-
-24.2.Development
-
-Each release cycle consist of two months of development on the master
-branch and one month stabilization before the release is made. During
-this phase no new features are added to master, only bugfixes.
-
-The stabilization phase starts with tagging -rc1, and every week
-until the release, another release candidate is tagged.
-
-To handle new features and version bumps during the stabilization
-phase, a next branch may be created for these features. Once the
-current release has been made, the next branch is merged into master
-and the development cycle for the next release continues there.

-Chapter25.Makedev syntax documentation
-
-The makedev syntax is used in several places in Buildroot to define
-changes to be made for permissions, or which device files to create
-and how to create them, in order to avoid calls to mknod.
-
-This syntax is derived from the makedev utility, and more complete
-documentation can be found in the package/makedevs/README file.
-
-It takes the form of a space separated list of fields, one file per
-line; the fields are:
-
-+--------------------------------------------------+
-|name|type|mode|uid|gid|major|minor|start|inc|count|
-+--------------------------------------------------+
-
-There are a few non-trivial blocks:
-
-  * name is the path to the file you want to create/modify
-  * type is the type of the file, being one of:
-
-      + f: a regular file
-      + d: a directory
-      + r: a directory recursively
-      + c: a character device file
-      + b: a block device file
-      + p: a named pipe
-  * mode are the usual permissions settings (only numerical values
-    are allowed)
-  * uid and gid are the UID and GID to set on this file; can be
-    either numerical values or actual names
-  * major and minor are here for device files, set to - for other
-    files
-  * start, inc and count are for when you want to create a batch of
-    files, and can be reduced to a loop, beginning at start,
-    incrementing its counter by inc until it reaches count
-
-Lets say you want to change the permissions of a given file; using
-this syntax, you will need to write:
-
-/usr/bin/foo f 755 0 0 - - - - -
-/usr/bin/bar f 755 root root - - - - -
-/data/buz f 644 buz-user buz-group - - - - -
-
-Alternatively, if you want to change owner/permission of a directory
-recursively, you can write (to set UID to foo, GID to bar and access
-rights to rwxr-x--- for the directory /usr/share/myapp and all files
-and directories below it):
-
-/usr/share/myapp r 750 foo bar - - - - -
-
-On the other hand, if you want to create the device file /dev/hda and
-the corresponding 15 files for the partitions, you will need for /dev
-/hda:
-
-/dev/hda b 640 root root 3 0 0 0 -
-
-and then for device files corresponding to the partitions of /dev/
-hda, /dev/hdaX, X ranging from 1 to 15:
-
-/dev/hda b 640 root root 3 1 1 1 15
-
-Extended attributes are supported if
-BR2_ROOTFS_DEVICE_TABLE_SUPPORTS_EXTENDED_ATTRIBUTES is enabled. This
-is done by adding a line starting with |xattr after the line
-describing the file. Right now, only capability is supported as
-extended attribute.
-
-+------------------+
-||xattr|capability |
-+------------------+
-
-  * |xattr is a "flag" that indicate an extended attribute
-  * capability is a capability to add to the previous file
-
-If you want to add the capability cap_sys_admin to the binary foo,
-you will write :
-
-/usr/bin/foo f 755 root root - - - - -
-|xattr cap_sys_admin+eip
-
-You can add several capabilities to a file by using several |xattr
-lines. If you want to add the capability cap_sys_admin and
-cap_net_admin to the binary foo, you will write :
-
-/usr/bin/foo f 755 root root - - - - -
-|xattr cap_sys_admin+eip
-|xattr cap_net_admin+eip

-Chapter26.Makeusers syntax documentation
-
-The syntax to create users is inspired by the makedev syntax, above,
-but is specific to Buildroot.
-
-The syntax for adding a user is a space-separated list of fields, one
-user per line; the fields are:
-
-+---------------------------------------------------------+
-|username|uid|group|gid|password|home|shell|groups|comment|
-+---------------------------------------------------------+
-
-Where:
-
-  * username is the desired user name (aka login name) for the user.
-    It can not be root, and must be unique. If set to -, then just a
-    group will be created.
-  * uid is the desired UID for the user. It must be unique, and not
-    0. If set to -1, then a unique UID will be computed by Buildroot
-    in the range [10001999]
-  * group is the desired name for the users main group. It can not
-    be root. If the group does not exist, it will be created.
-  * gid is the desired GID for the users main group. It must be
-    unique, and not 0. If set to -1, and the group does not already
-    exist, then a unique GID will be computed by Buildroot in the
-    range [1000..1999]
-  * password is the crypt(3)-encoded password. If prefixed with !,
-    then login is disabled. If prefixed with =, then it is
-    interpreted as clear-text, and will be crypt-encoded (using MD5).
-    If prefixed with !=, then the password will be crypt-encoded
-    (using MD5) and login will be disabled. If set to *, then login
-    is not allowed. If set to -, then no password value will be set.
-  * home is the desired home directory for the user. If set to -, no
-    home directory will be created, and the users home will be /.
-    Explicitly setting home to / is not allowed.
-  * shell is the desired shell for the user. If set to -, then /bin/
-    false is set as the users shell.
-  * groups is the comma-separated list of additional groups the user
-    should be part of. If set to -, then the user will be a member of
-    no additional group. Missing groups will be created with an
-    arbitrary gid.
-  * comment (aka GECOS [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecos_field]
-    field) is an almost-free-form text.
-
-There are a few restrictions on the content of each field:
-
-  * except for comment, all fields are mandatory.
-  * except for comment, fields may not contain spaces.
-  * no field may contain a colon (:).
-
-If home is not -, then the home directory, and all files below, will
-belong to the user and its main group.
-
-Examples:
-
-foo -1 bar -1 !=blabla /home/foo /bin/sh alpha,bravo Foo user
-
-This will create this user:
-
-  * username (aka login name) is: foo
-  * uid is computed by Buildroot
-  * main group is: bar
-  * main group gid is computed by Buildroot
-  * clear-text password is: blabla, will be crypt(3)-encoded, and
-    login is disabled.
-  * home is: /home/foo
-  * shell is: /bin/sh
-  * foo is also a member of groups: alpha and bravo
-  * comment is: Foo user
-
-test 8000 wheel -1 = - /bin/sh - Test user
-
-This will create this user:
-
-  * username (aka login name) is: test
-  * uid is : 8000
-  * main group is: wheel
-  * main group gid is computed by Buildroot, and will use the value
-    defined in the rootfs skeleton
-  * password is empty (aka no password).
-  * home is / but will not belong to test
-  * shell is: /bin/sh
-  * test is not a member of any additional groups
-  * comment is: Test user

-Chapter27.Migrating from older Buildroot versions
-
-Some versions have introduced backward incompatibilities. This
-section explains those incompatibilities, and for each explains what
-to do to complete the migration.
-
-27.1.General approach
-
-To migrate from an older Buildroot version, take the following steps.
-
- 1. For all your configurations, do a build in the old Buildroot
-    environment. Run make graph-size. Save graphs/file-size-stats.csv
-    in a different location. Run make clean to remove the rest.
- 2. Review the specific migration notes below and make the required
-    adaptations to external packages and custom build scripts.
- 3. Update Buildroot.
- 4. Run make menuconfig starting from the existing .config.
- 5. If anything is enabled in the Legacy menu, check its help text,
-    unselect it, and save the configuration.
- 6. For more details, review the git commit messages for the packages
-    that you need. Change into the packages directory and run git log
-    <old version>..<your packages>.
- 7. Build in the new Buildroot environment.
- 8. Fix build issues in external packages (usually due to updated
-    dependencies).
- 9. Run make graph-size.
-10. Compare the new file-size-stats.csv with the original one, to
-    check if no required files have disappeared and if no new big
-    unneeded files have appeared.
-11. For configuration (and other) files in a custom overlay that
-    overwrite files created by Buildroot, check if there are changes
-    in the Buildroot-generated file that need to be propagated to
-    your custom file.
-
-27.2.Migrating to 2016.11
-
-Before Buildroot 2016.11, it was possible to use only one
-br2-external tree at once. With Buildroot 2016.11 came the
-possibility to use more than one simultaneously (for details, see
-Section9.2, Keeping customizations outside of Buildroot).
-
-This however means that older br2-external trees are not usable
-as-is. A minor change has to be made: adding a name to your
-br2-external tree.
-
-This can be done very easily in just a few steps:
-
-  * First, create a new file named external.desc, at the root of your
-    br2-external tree, with a single line defining the name of your
-    br2-external tree:
-
-    $ echo 'name: NAME_OF_YOUR_TREE' >external.desc
-
-    Note.Be careful when choosing a name: It has to be unique and be
-    made with only ASCII characters from the set [A-Za-z0-9_].
-
-  * Then, change every occurence of BR2_EXTERNAL in your br2-external
-    tree with the new variable:
-
-    $ find . -type f | xargs sed -i 's/BR2_EXTERNAL/BR2_EXTERNAL_NAME_OF_YOUR_TREE_PATH/g'
-
-Now, your br2-external tree can be used with Buildroot 2016.11
-onward.
-
-Note:This change makes your br2-external tree incompatible with
-Buildroot before 2016.11.
-
-27.3.Migrating to 2017.08
-
-Before Buildroot 2017.08, host packages were installed in $(HOST_DIR)
-/usr (with e.g. the autotools' --prefix=$(HOST_DIR)/usr). With
-Buildroot 2017.08, they are now installed directly in $(HOST_DIR).
-
-Whenever a package installs an executable that is linked with a
-library in $(HOST_DIR)/lib, it must have an RPATH pointing to that
-directory.
-
-An RPATH pointing to $(HOST_DIR)/usr/lib is no longer accepted.

-== Patching a package
-
-While integrating a new package or updating an existing one, it may be
-necessary to patch the source of the software to get it cross-built within
-Buildroot.
-
-Buildroot offers an infrastructure to automatically handle this during
-the builds. It supports three ways of applying patch sets: downloaded patches,
-patches supplied within buildroot and patches located in a user-defined
-global patch directory.
-
-=== Providing patches
-
-==== Downloaded
-
-If it is necessary to apply a patch that is available for download, then add it
-to the +<packagename>_PATCH+ variable. If an entry contains +://+,
-then Buildroot will assume it is a full URL and download the patch
-from this location. Otherwise, Buildroot will assume that the patch should be
-downloaded from +<packagename>_SITE+. It can be a single patch,
-or a tarball containing a patch series.
-
-Like for all downloads, a hash should be added to the +<packagename>.hash+
-file.
-
-This method is typically used for packages from Debian.
-
-==== Within Buildroot
-
-Most patches are provided within Buildroot, in the package
-directory; these typically aim to fix cross-compilation, libc support,
-or other such issues.
-
-These patch files should be named +<number>-<description>.patch+.
-
-.Notes
-- The patch files coming with Buildroot should not contain any package version
-  reference in their filename.
-- The field +<number>+ in the patch file name refers to the 'apply order',
-  and shall start at 1; It is preferred to pad the number with zeros up to 4
-  digits, like 'git-format-patch' does. E.g.: +0001-foobar-the-buz.patch+
-- Previously, it was mandatory for patches to be prefixed with the name of
-  the package, like +<package>-<number>-<description>.patch+, but that is
-  no longer the case. Existing packages will be fixed as time passes. 'Do
-  not prefix patches with the package name.'
-- Previously, a +series+ file, as used by +quilt+, could also be added in
-  the package directory. In that case, the +series+ file defines the patch
-  application order. This is deprecated, and will be removed in the future.
-  'Do not use a series file.'
-
-
-==== Global patch directory
-
-The +BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR+ configuration file option can be
-used to specify a space separated list of one or more directories
-containing global package patches. See xref:customize-patches[] for
-details.
-
-[[patch-apply-order]]
-=== How patches are applied
-
-. Run the +<packagename>_PRE_PATCH_HOOKS+ commands if defined;
-
-. Cleanup the build directory, removing any existing +*.rej+ files;
-
-. If +<packagename>_PATCH+ is defined, then patches from these
-  tarballs are applied;
-
-. If there are some +*.patch+ files in the package's Buildroot
-  directory or in a package subdirectory named +<packageversion>+,
-  then:
-+
-* If a +series+ file exists in the package directory, then patches are
-  applied according to the +series+ file;
-+
-* Otherwise, patch files matching +*.patch+ are applied in alphabetical
-  order.
-  So, to ensure they are applied in the right order, it is highly
-  recommended to name the patch files like this:
-  +<number>-<description>.patch+, where +<number>+ refers to the
-  'apply order'.
-
-. If +BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR+ is defined, the directories will be
-  enumerated in the order they are specified. The patches are applied
-  as described in the previous step.
-
-. Run the +<packagename>_POST_PATCH_HOOKS+ commands if defined.
-
-If something goes wrong in the steps _3_ or _4_, then the build fails.
-
-=== Format and licensing of the package patches
-
-Patches are released under the same license as the software they apply
-to (see xref:legal-info-buildroot[]).
-
-A message explaining what the patch does, and why it is needed, should
-be added in the header commentary of the patch.
-
-You should add a +Signed-off-by+ statement in the header of the each
-patch to help with keeping track of the changes and to certify that the
-patch is released under the same license as the software that is modified.
-
-If the software is under version control, it is recommended to use the
-upstream SCM software to generate the patch set.
-
-Otherwise, concatenate the header with the output of the
-+diff -purN package-version.orig/ package-version/+ command.
-
-If you update an existing patch (e.g. when bumping the package version),
-make sure the existing From header and Signed-off-by tags are not
-removed, but do update the rest of the patch comment when appropriate.
-
-At the end, the patch should look like:
-
----------------
-configure.ac: add C++ support test
-
-Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@noname.org>
-
---- configure.ac.orig
-+++ configure.ac

----------------
-
-=== Integrating patches found on the Web
-
-When integrating a patch of which you are not the author, you have to
-add a few things in the header of the patch itself.
-
-Depending on whether the patch has been obtained from the project
-repository itself, or from somewhere on the web, add one of the
-following tags:
-
----------------
-Backported from: <some commit id>
----------------
-
-or
-
----------------
-Fetch from: <some url>
----------------
-
-It is also sensible to add a few words about any changes to the patch
-that may have been necessary.

-[[requirement]]
-== System requirements
-
-Buildroot is designed to run on Linux systems.
-
-While Buildroot itself will build most host packages it needs for the
-compilation, certain standard Linux utilities are expected to be
-already installed on the host system. Below you will find an overview of
-the mandatory and optional packages (note that package names may vary
-between distributions).
-
-[[requirement-mandatory]]
-
-=== Mandatory packages
-
-* Build tools:
-
-** +which+
-** +sed+
-** +make+ (version 3.81 or any later)
-** +binutils+
-** +build-essential+ (only for Debian based systems)
-** +gcc+ (version 4.8 or any later)
-** `g++` (version 4.8 or any later)
-** +bash+
-** +patch+
-** +gzip+
-** +bzip2+
-** +perl+ (version 5.8.7 or any later)
-** +tar+
-** +cpio+
-** +unzip+
-** +rsync+
-** +file+ (must be in +/usr/bin/file+)
-** +bc+
-
-* Source fetching tools:
-** +wget+
-
-[[requirement-optional]]
-
-=== Optional packages
-
-* Recommended dependencies:
-+
-Some features or utilities in Buildroot, like the legal-info, or the
-graph generation tools, have additional dependencies. Although they
-are not mandatory for a simple build, they are still highly recommended:
-+
-** +python+ (version 2.7 or any later)
-
-* Configuration interface dependencies:
-+
-For these libraries, you need to install both runtime and development
-data, which in many distributions are packaged separately. The
-development packages typically have a _-dev_ or _-devel_ suffix.
-+
-** +ncurses5+ to use the 'menuconfig' interface
-** +qt5+ to use the 'xconfig' interface
-** +glib2+, +gtk2+ and +glade2+ to use the 'gconfig' interface
-
-* Source fetching tools:
-+
-In the official tree, most of the package sources are retrieved using
-+wget+ from _ftp_, _http_ or _https_ locations. A few packages are only
-available through a version control system. Moreover, Buildroot is
-capable of downloading sources via other tools, like +rsync+ or +scp+
-(refer to xref:download-infra[] for more details). If you enable
-packages using any of these methods, you will need to install the
-corresponding tool on the host system:
-+
-** +bazaar+
-** +cvs+
-** +git+
-** +mercurial+
-** +rsync+
-** +scp+
-** +subversion+
-
-* Java-related packages, if the Java Classpath needs to be built for
-  the target system:
-** The +javac+ compiler
-** The +jar+ tool
-
-* Documentation generation tools:
-** +asciidoc+, version 8.6.3 or higher
-** +w3m+
-** +python+ with the +argparse+ module (automatically present in 2.7+ and 3.2+)
-** +dblatex+ (required for the pdf manual only)
-
-* Graph generation tools:
-** +graphviz+ to use 'graph-depends' and '<pkg>-graph-depends'
-** +python-matplotlib+ to use 'graph-build'

-
-== Buildroot quick start
-
-*Important*: you can and should *build everything as a normal user*. There
-is no need to be root to configure and use Buildroot. By running all
-commands as a regular user, you protect your system against packages
-behaving badly during compilation and installation.
-
-The first step when using Buildroot is to create a configuration.
-Buildroot has a nice configuration tool similar to the one you can
-find in the http://www.kernel.org/[Linux kernel] or in
-http://www.busybox.net/[BusyBox].
-
-From the buildroot directory, run
-
---------------------
- $ make menuconfig
---------------------
-
-for the original curses-based configurator, or
-
---------------------
- $ make nconfig
---------------------
-
-for the new curses-based configurator, or
-
---------------------
- $ make xconfig
---------------------
-
-for the Qt-based configurator, or
-
---------------------
- $ make gconfig
---------------------
-
-for the GTK-based configurator.
-
-All of these "make" commands will need to build a configuration
-utility (including the interface), so you may need to install
-"development" packages for relevant libraries used by the
-configuration utilities. Refer to xref:requirement[] for more details,
-specifically the xref:requirement-optional[optional requirements]
-to get the dependencies of your favorite interface.
-
-For each menu entry in the configuration tool, you can find associated
-help that describes the purpose of the entry. Refer to xref:configure[]
-for details on some specific configuration aspects.
-
-Once everything is configured, the configuration tool generates a
-+.config+ file that contains the entire configuration. This file will be
-read by the top-level Makefile.
-
-To start the build process, simply run:
-
---------------------
- $ make
---------------------
-
-By default, Buildroot does not support top-level parallel build, so
-running +make -jN+ is not necessary. There is however experimental
-support for top-level parallel build, see
-xref:top-level-parallel-build[].
-
-The `make` command will generally perform the following steps:
-
-* download source files (as required);
-* configure, build and install the cross-compilation toolchain, or
-  simply import an external toolchain;
-* configure, build and install selected target packages;
-* build a kernel image, if selected;
-* build a bootloader image, if selected;
-* create a root filesystem in selected formats.
-
-Buildroot output is stored in a single directory, +output/+.
-This directory contains several subdirectories:
-
-* +images/+ where all the images (kernel image, bootloader and root
-  filesystem images) are stored. These are the files you need to put
-  on your target system.
-
-* +build/+ where all the components are built (this includes tools
-  needed by Buildroot on the host and packages compiled for the
-  target). This directory contains one subdirectory for each of these
-  components.
-
-* +host/+ contains both the tools built for the host, and the sysroot
-  of the target toolchain. The former is an installation of tools
-  compiled for the host that are needed for the proper execution of
-  Buildroot, including the cross-compilation toolchain. The latter
-  is a hierarchy similar to a root filesystem hierarchy. It contains
-  the headers and libraries of all user-space packages that provide
-  and install libraries used by other packages. However, this
-  directory is 'not' intended to be the root filesystem for the target:
-  it contains a lot of development files, unstripped binaries and
-  libraries that make it far too big for an embedded system. These
-  development files are used to compile libraries and applications for
-  the target that depend on other libraries.
-
-* +staging/+ is a symlink to the target toolchain sysroot inside
-  +host/+, which exists for backwards compatibility.
-
-* +target/+ which contains 'almost' the complete root filesystem for
-  the target: everything needed is present except the device files in
-  +/dev/+ (Buildroot can't create them because Buildroot doesn't run
-  as root and doesn't want to run as root). Also, it doesn't have the correct
-  permissions (e.g. setuid for the busybox binary). Therefore, this directory
-  *should not be used on your target*. Instead, you should use one of
-  the images built in the +images/+ directory. If you need an
-  extracted image of the root filesystem for booting over NFS, then
-  use the tarball image generated in +images/+ and extract it as
-  root. Compared to +staging/+, +target/+ contains only the files and
-  libraries needed to run the selected target applications: the
-  development files (headers, etc.) are not present, the binaries are
-  stripped.
-
-These commands, +make menuconfig|nconfig|gconfig|xconfig+ and +make+, are the
-basic ones that allow to easily and quickly generate images fitting
-your needs, with all the features and applications you enabled.
-
-More details about the "make" command usage are given in
-xref:make-tips[].

-[[full-rebuild]]
-=== Understanding when a full rebuild is necessary
-
-Buildroot does not attempt to detect what parts of the system should
-be rebuilt when the system configuration is changed through +make
-menuconfig+, +make xconfig+ or one of the other configuration
-tools. In some cases, Buildroot should rebuild the entire system, in
-some cases, only a specific subset of packages. But detecting this in
-a completely reliable manner is very difficult, and therefore the
-Buildroot developers have decided to simply not attempt to do this.
-
-Instead, it is the responsibility of the user to know when a full
-rebuild is necessary. As a hint, here are a few rules of thumb that
-can help you understand how to work with Buildroot:
-
- * When the target architecture configuration is changed, a complete
-   rebuild is needed. Changing the architecture variant, the binary
-   format or the floating point strategy for example has an impact on
-   the entire system.
-
- * When the toolchain configuration is changed, a complete rebuild
-   generally is needed. Changing the toolchain configuration often
-   involves changing the compiler version, the type of C library or
-   its configuration, or some other fundamental configuration item,
-   and these changes have an impact on the entire system.
-
- * When an additional package is added to the configuration, a full
-   rebuild is not necessarily needed. Buildroot will detect that this
-   package has never been built, and will build it. However, if this
-   package is a library that can optionally be used by packages that
-   have already been built, Buildroot will not automatically rebuild
-   those. Either you know which packages should be rebuilt, and you
-   can rebuild them manually, or you should do a full rebuild. For
-   example, let's suppose you have built a system with the +ctorrent+
-   package, but without +openssl+. Your system works, but you realize
-   you would like to have SSL support in +ctorrent+, so you enable the
-   +openssl+ package in Buildroot configuration and restart the
-   build. Buildroot will detect that +openssl+ should be built and
-   will be build it, but it will not detect that +ctorrent+ should be
-   rebuilt to benefit from +openssl+ to add OpenSSL support. You will
-   either have to do a full rebuild, or rebuild +ctorrent+ itself.
-
- * When a package is removed from the configuration, Buildroot does
-   not do anything special. It does not remove the files installed by
-   this package from the target root filesystem or from the toolchain
-   _sysroot_. A full rebuild is needed to get rid of this
-   package. However, generally you don't necessarily need this package
-   to be removed right now: you can wait for the next lunch break to
-   restart the build from scratch.
-
- * When the sub-options of a package are changed, the package is not
-   automatically rebuilt. After making such changes, rebuilding only
-   this package is often sufficient, unless enabling the package
-   sub-option adds some features to the package that are useful for
-   another package which has already been built. Again, Buildroot does
-   not track when a package should be rebuilt: once a package has been
-   built, it is never rebuilt unless explicitly told to do so.
-
- * When a change to the root filesystem skeleton is made, a full
-   rebuild is needed. However, when changes to the root filesystem
-   overlay, a post-build script or a post-image script are made,
-   there is no need for a full rebuild: a simple +make+ invocation
-   will take the changes into account.
-
- * When a package listed in +FOO_DEPENDENCIES+ is rebuilt or removed,
-   the package +foo+ is not automatically rebuilt. For example, if a
-   package +bar+ is listed in +FOO_DEPENDENCIES+ with +FOO_DEPENDENCIES
-   = bar+ and the configuration of the +bar+ package is changed, the
-   configuration change would not result in a rebuild of package +foo+
-   automatically. In this scenario, you may need to either rebuild any
-   packages in your build which reference +bar+ in their +DEPENDENCIES+,
-   or perform a full rebuild to ensure any +bar+ dependent packages are
-   up to date.
-
-Generally speaking, when you're facing a build error and you're unsure
-of the potential consequences of the configuration changes you've
-made, do a full rebuild. If you get the same build error, then you are
-sure that the error is not related to partial rebuilds of packages,
-and if this error occurs with packages from the official Buildroot, do
-not hesitate to report the problem! As your experience with Buildroot
-progresses, you will progressively learn when a full rebuild is really
-necessary, and you will save more and more time.
-
-For reference, a full rebuild is achieved by running:
-
----------------
-$ make clean all
----------------
-
-[[rebuild-pkg]]
-=== Understanding how to rebuild packages
-
-One of the most common questions asked by Buildroot users is how to
-rebuild a given package or how to remove a package without rebuilding
-everything from scratch.
-
-Removing a package is unsupported by Buildroot without
-rebuilding from scratch. This is because Buildroot doesn't keep track
-of which package installs what files in the +output/staging+ and
-+output/target+ directories, or which package would be compiled differently
-depending on the availability of another package.
-
-The easiest way to rebuild a single package from scratch is to remove
-its build directory in +output/build+. Buildroot will then re-extract,
-re-configure, re-compile and re-install this package from scratch. You
-can ask buildroot to do this with the +make <package>-dirclean+ command.
-
-On the other hand, if you only want to restart the build process of a
-package from its compilation step, you can run +make <package>-rebuild+. It
-will restart the compilation and installation of the package, but not from
-scratch: it basically re-executes +make+ and +make install+ inside the package,
-so it will only rebuild files that changed.
-
-If you want to restart the build process of a package from its configuration
-step, you can run +make <package>-reconfigure+. It will restart the
-configuration, compilation and installation of the package.
-
-While +<package>-rebuild+ implies +<package>-reinstall+ and
-+<package>-reconfigure+ implies +<package>-rebuild+, these targets as well
-as +<package>+ only act on the said package, and do not trigger re-creating
-the root filesystem image. If re-creating the root filesystem in necessary,
-one should in addition run +make+ or +make all+.
-
-Internally, Buildroot creates so-called _stamp files_ to keep track of
-which build steps have been completed for each package. They are
-stored in the package build directory,
-+output/build/<package>-<version>/+ and are named
-+.stamp_<step-name>+. The commands detailed above simply manipulate
-these stamp files to force Buildroot to restart a specific set of
-steps of a package build process.
-
-Further details about package special make targets are explained in
-xref:pkg-build-steps[].

-== Release Engineering
-=== Releases
-
-The Buildroot project makes quarterly releases with monthly bugfix
-releases.  The first release of each year is a long term support
-release, LTS.
-
- - Quarterly releases: 2020.02, 2020.05, 2020.08, and 2020.11
- - Bugfix releases: 2020.02.1, 2020.02.2, ...
- - LTS releases: 2020.02, 2021.02, ...
-
-Releases are supported until the first bugfix release of the next
-release, e.g., 2020.05.x is EOL when 2020.08.1 is released.
-
-LTS releases are supported until the first bugfix release of the next
-LTS, e.g., 2020.02.x is supported until 2021.02.1 is released.
-
-=== Development
-
-Each release cycle consist of two months of development on the +master+
-branch and one month stabilization before the release is made.  During
-this phase no new features are added to +master+, only bugfixes.
-
-The stabilization phase starts with tagging +-rc1+, and every week until
-the release, another release candidate is tagged.
-
-To handle new features and version bumps during the stabilization phase,
-a +next+ branch may be created for these features.  Once the current
-release has been made, the +next+ branch is merged into +master+ and
-the development cycle for the next release continues there.

-[[selinux]]
-== Using SELinux in Buildroot
-
-https://selinuxproject.org[SELinux] is a Linux kernel security module
-enforcing access control policies. In addition to the traditional file
-permissions and access control lists, +SELinux+ allows to write rules
-for users or processes to access specific functions of resources
-(files, sockets...).
-
-_SELinux_ has three modes of operation:
-
-* _Disabled_: the policy is not applied
-* _Permissive_: the policy is applied, and non-authorized actions are
-  simply logged. This mode is often used for troubleshooting SELinux
-  issues.
-* _Enforcing_: the policy is applied, and non-authorized actions are
-  denied
-
-In Buildroot the mode of operation is controlled by the
-+BR2_PACKAGE_REFPOLICY_POLICY_STATE_*+ configuration options. The
-Linux kernel also has various configuration options that affect how
-+SELinux+ is enabled (see +security/selinux/Kconfig+ in the Linux
-kernel sources).
-
-By default in Buildroot the +SELinux+ policy is provided by the
-upstream https://github.com/SELinuxProject/refpolicy[refpolicy]
-project, enabled with +BR2_PACKAGE_REFPOLICY+.
-
-[[enabling-selinux]]
-=== Enabling SELinux support
-
-To have proper support for +SELinux+ in a Buildroot generated system,
-the following configuration options must be enabled:
-
-* +BR2_PACKAGE_LIBSELINUX+
-* +BR2_PACKAGE_REFPOLICY+
-
-In addition, your filesystem image format must support extended
-attributes.
-
-[[selinux-policy-tweaking]]
-=== SELinux policy tweaking
-
-The +SELinux refpolicy+ contains modules that can be enabled or
-disabled when being built. Each module provide a number of +SELinux+
-rules. In Buildroot the non-base modules are disabled by default and
-several ways to enable such modules are provided:
-
-- Packages can enable a list of +SELinux+ modules within the +refpolicy+ using
-  the +<packagename>_SELINUX_MODULES+ variable.
-- Packages can provide additional +SELinux+ modules by putting them (.fc, .if
-  and .te files) in +package/<packagename>/selinux/+.
-- Extra +SELinux+ modules can be added in directories pointed by the
-  +BR2_REFPOLICY_EXTRA_MODULES_DIRS+ configuration option.
-- Additional modules in the +refpolicy+ can be enabled if listed in the
-  +BR2_REFPOLICY_EXTRA_MODULES_DEPENDENCIES+ configuration option.
-
-Buildroot also allows to completely override the +refpolicy+. This
-allows to provide a full custom policy designed specifically for a
-given system. When going this way, all of the above mechanisms are
-disabled: no extra +SElinux+ module is added to the policy, and all
-the available modules within the custom policy are enabled and built
-into the final binary policy. The custom policy must be a fork of the
-official https://github.com/SELinuxProject/refpolicy[refpolicy].
-
-In order to fully override the +refpolicy+ the following configuration
-variables have to be set:
-
-- +BR2_PACKAGE_REFPOLICY_CUSTOM_GIT+
-- +BR2_PACKAGE_REFPOLICY_CUSTOM_REPO_URL+
-- +BR2_PACKAGE_REFPOLICY_CUSTOM_REPO_VERSION+

-==== Using +gdb+ in Buildroot
-
-Buildroot allows to do cross-debugging, where the debugger runs on the
-build machine and communicates with +gdbserver+ on the target to
-control the execution of the program.
-
-To achieve this:
-
-* If you are using an _internal toolchain_ (built by Buildroot), you
-  must enable +BR2_PACKAGE_HOST_GDB+, +BR2_PACKAGE_GDB+ and
-  +BR2_PACKAGE_GDB_SERVER+. This ensures that both the cross gdb and
-  gdbserver get built, and that gdbserver gets installed to your target.
-
-* If you are using an _external toolchain_, you should enable
-  +BR2_TOOLCHAIN_EXTERNAL_GDB_SERVER_COPY+, which will copy the
-  gdbserver included with the external toolchain to the target. If your
-  external toolchain does not have a cross gdb or gdbserver, it is also
-  possible to let Buildroot build them, by enabling the same options as
-  for the _internal toolchain backend_.
-
-Now, to start debugging a program called +foo+, you should run on the
-target:
-
-----------------------------
-gdbserver :2345 foo
-----------------------------
-
-This will cause +gdbserver+ to listen on TCP port 2345 for a connection
-from the cross gdb.
-
-Then, on the host, you should start the cross gdb using the following
-command line:
-
-----------------------------
-<buildroot>/output/host/bin/<tuple>-gdb -ix <buildroot>/output/staging/usr/share/buildroot/gdbinit foo
-----------------------------
-
-Of course, +foo+ must be available in the current directory, built
-with debugging symbols. Typically you start this command from the
-directory where +foo+ is built (and not from +output/target/+ as the
-binaries in that directory are stripped).
-
-The +<buildroot>/output/staging/usr/share/buildroot/gdbinit+ file will tell the
-cross gdb where to find the libraries of the target.
-
-Finally, to connect to the target from the cross gdb:
-
-----------------------------
-(gdb) target remote <target ip address>:2345

-==== Using Buildroot during development
-
-The normal operation of Buildroot is to download a tarball, extract
-it, configure, compile and install the software component found inside
-this tarball. The source code is extracted in
-+output/build/<package>-<version>+, which is a temporary directory:
-whenever +make clean+ is used, this directory is entirely removed, and
-re-created at the next +make+ invocation. Even when a Git or
-Subversion repository is used as the input for the package source
-code, Buildroot creates a tarball out of it, and then behaves as it
-normally does with tarballs.
-
-This behavior is well-suited when Buildroot is used mainly as an
-integration tool, to build and integrate all the components of an
-embedded Linux system. However, if one uses Buildroot during the
-development of certain components of the system, this behavior is not
-very convenient: one would instead like to make a small change to the
-source code of one package, and be able to quickly rebuild the system
-with Buildroot.
-
-Making changes directly in +output/build/<package>-<version>+ is not
-an appropriate solution, because this directory is removed on +make
-clean+.
-
-Therefore, Buildroot provides a specific mechanism for this use case:
-the +<pkg>_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR+ mechanism. Buildroot reads an _override_
-file, which allows the user to tell Buildroot the location of the
-source for certain packages.
-
-The default location of the override file is +$(CONFIG_DIR)/local.mk+,
-as defined by the +BR2_PACKAGE_OVERRIDE_FILE+ configuration option.
-+$(CONFIG_DIR)+ is the location of the Buildroot +.config+ file, so
-+local.mk+ by default lives side-by-side with the +.config+ file,
-which means:
-
-* In the top-level Buildroot source directory for in-tree builds
-  (i.e., when +O=+ is not used)
-* In the out-of-tree directory for out-of-tree builds (i.e., when
-  +O=+ is used)
-
-If a different location than these defaults is required, it can be
-specified through the +BR2_PACKAGE_OVERRIDE_FILE+ configuration
-option.
-
-In this _override_ file, Buildroot expects to find lines of the form:
-
-------------------
-<pkg1>_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR = /path/to/pkg1/sources
-<pkg2>_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR = /path/to/pkg2/sources
-------------------
-
-For example:
-
-------------------
-LINUX_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR = /home/bob/linux/
-BUSYBOX_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR = /home/bob/busybox/
-------------------
-
-When Buildroot finds that for a given package, an
-+<pkg>_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR+ has been defined, it will no longer attempt to
-download, extract and patch the package. Instead, it will directly use
-the source code available in the specified directory and +make clean+
-will not touch this directory. This allows to point Buildroot to your
-own directories, that can be managed by Git, Subversion, or any other
-version control system. To achieve this, Buildroot will use _rsync_ to
-copy the source code of the component from the specified
-+<pkg>_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR+ to +output/build/<package>-custom/+.
-
-This mechanism is best used in conjunction with the +make
-<pkg>-rebuild+ and +make <pkg>-reconfigure+ targets. A +make
-<pkg>-rebuild all+ sequence will _rsync_ the source code from
-+<pkg>_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR+ to +output/build/<package>-custom+ (thanks to
-_rsync_, only the modified files are copied), and restart the build
-process of just this package.
-
-In the example of the +linux+ package above, the developer can then
-make a source code change in +/home/bob/linux+ and then run:
-
------------------------
-make linux-rebuild all
------------------------
-
-and in a matter of seconds gets the updated Linux kernel image in
-+output/images+. Similarly, a change can be made to the BusyBox source
-code in +/home/bob/busybox+, and after:
-
------------------------
-make busybox-rebuild all
------------------------
-
-the root filesystem image in +output/images+ contains the updated
-BusyBox.
-
-Source trees for big projects often contain hundreds or thousands of
-files which are not needed for building, but will slow down the process
-of copying the sources with _rsync_. Optionally, it is possible define
-+<pkg>_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR_RSYNC_EXCLUSIONS+ to skip syncing certain files
-from the source tree. For example, when working on the +webkitgtk+
-package, the following will exclude the tests and in-tree builds from
-a local WebKit source tree:
-
-------------------
-WEBKITGTK_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR = /home/bob/WebKit
-WEBKITGTK_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR_RSYNC_EXCLUSIONS = \
-	--exclude JSTests --exclude ManualTests --exclude PerformanceTests \
-	--exclude WebDriverTests --exclude WebKitBuild --exclude WebKitLibraries \
-	--exclude WebKit.xcworkspace --exclude Websites --exclude Examples
-------------------
-
-By default, Buildroot skips syncing of VCS artifacts (e.g., the *.git* and
-*.svn* directories). Some packages prefer to have these VCS directories
-available during build, for example for automatically determining a precise
-commit reference for version information. To undo this built-in filtering at a
-cost of a slower speed, add these directories back:
-
-------------------
-LINUX_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR_RSYNC_EXCLUSIONS = --include .git

-
-==== Using the generated toolchain outside Buildroot
-
-You may want to compile, for your target, your own programs or other
-software that are not packaged in Buildroot. In order to do this you
-can use the toolchain that was generated by Buildroot.
-
-The toolchain generated by Buildroot is located by default in
-+output/host/+. The simplest way to use it is to add
-+output/host/bin/+ to your PATH environment variable and then to
-use +ARCH-linux-gcc+, +ARCH-linux-objdump+, +ARCH-linux-ld+, etc.
-
-Alternatively, Buildroot can also export the toolchain and the development
-files of all selected packages, as an SDK, by running the command
-+make sdk+. This generates a tarball of the content of the host directory
-+output/host/+, named +<TARGET-TUPLE>_sdk-buildroot.tar.gz+ (which can be
-overriden by setting the environment variable +BR2_SDK_PREFIX+) and
-located in the output directory +output/images/+.
-
-This tarball can then be distributed to application developers, when
-they want to develop their applications that are not (yet) packaged as
-a Buildroot package.
-
-Upon extracting the SDK tarball, the user must run the script
-+relocate-sdk.sh+ (located at the top directory of the SDK), to make
-sure all paths are updated with the new location.
-
-Alternatively, if you just want to prepare the SDK without generating
-the tarball (e.g. because you will just be moving the +host+ directory,
-or will be generating the tarball on your own), Buildroot also allows
-you to just prepare the SDK with +make prepare-sdk+ without actually
-generating a tarball.
-
-For your convenience, by selecting the option
-+BR2_PACKAGE_HOST_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP+, you can get a
-+environment-setup+ script installed in +output/host/+ and therefore
-in your SDK.  This script can be sourced with
-+. your/sdk/path/environment-setup+ to export a number of environment
-variables that will help cross-compile your projects using the
-Buildroot SDK: the +PATH+ will contain the SDK binaries, standard
-_autotools_ variables will be defined with the appropriate values, and
-+CONFIGURE_FLAGS+ will contain basic +./configure+ options to
-cross-compile _autotools_ projects. It also provides some useful
-commands. Note however that once this script is sourced, the
-environment is setup only for cross-compilation, and no longer for
-native compilation.

-== Coding style
-
-Overall, these coding style rules are here to help you to add new files in
-Buildroot or refactor existing ones.
-
-If you slightly modify some existing file, the important thing is
-to keep the consistency of the whole file, so you can:
-
-* either follow the potentially deprecated coding style used in this
-file,
-
-* or entirely rework it in order to make it comply with these rules.
-
-[[writing-rules-config-in]]
-
-=== +Config.in+ file
-
-+Config.in+ files contain entries for almost anything configurable in
-Buildroot.
-
-An entry has the following pattern:
-
----------------------
-config BR2_PACKAGE_LIBFOO
-	bool "libfoo"
-	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_LIBBAZ
-	select BR2_PACKAGE_LIBBAR
-	help
-	  This is a comment that explains what libfoo is. The help text
-	  should be wrapped.
-
-	  http://foosoftware.org/libfoo/
----------------------
-
-* The +bool+, +depends on+, +select+ and +help+ lines are indented
-  with one tab.
-
-* The help text itself should be indented with one tab and two
-  spaces.
-
-* The help text should be wrapped to fit 72 columns, where tab counts
-  for 8, so 62 characters in the text itself.
-
-The +Config.in+ files are the input for the configuration tool
-used in Buildroot, which is the regular _Kconfig_. For further
-details about the _Kconfig_ language, refer to
-http://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt[].
-
-[[writing-rules-mk]]
-
-=== The +.mk+ file
-
-* Header: The file starts with a header. It contains the module name,
-preferably in lowercase, enclosed between separators made of 80 hashes. A
-blank line is mandatory after the header:
-+
----------------------
-################################################################################
-#
-# libfoo
-#
-################################################################################
----------------------
-+
-* Assignment: use +=+ preceded and followed by one space:
-+
----------------------
-LIBFOO_VERSION = 1.0
-LIBFOO_CONF_OPTS += --without-python-support
----------------------
-+
-Do not align the +=+ signs.
-
-* Indentation: use tab only:
-+
----------------------
-define LIBFOO_REMOVE_DOC
-	$(RM) -fr $(TARGET_DIR)/usr/share/libfoo/doc \
-		$(TARGET_DIR)/usr/share/man/man3/libfoo*
-endef
----------------------
-+
-Note that commands inside a +define+ block should always start with a tab,
-so _make_ recognizes them as commands.
-
-* Optional dependency:
-
-** Prefer multi-line syntax.
-+
-YES:
-+
----------------------
-ifeq ($(BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON),y)
-LIBFOO_CONF_OPTS += --with-python-support
-LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES += python
-else
-LIBFOO_CONF_OPTS += --without-python-support
-endif
----------------------
-+
-NO:
-+
----------------------
-LIBFOO_CONF_OPTS += --with$(if $(BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON),,out)-python-support
-LIBFOO_DEPENDENCIES += $(if $(BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON),python,)
----------------------
-
-** Keep configure options and dependencies close together.
-
-* Optional hooks: keep hook definition and assignment together in one
-  if block.
-+
-YES:
-+
----------------------
-ifneq ($(BR2_LIBFOO_INSTALL_DATA),y)
-define LIBFOO_REMOVE_DATA
-	$(RM) -fr $(TARGET_DIR)/usr/share/libfoo/data
-endef
-LIBFOO_POST_INSTALL_TARGET_HOOKS += LIBFOO_REMOVE_DATA
-endif
----------------------

-
-		Because you've only been granted anonymous access to the tree, you won't be

-	<p>Buildroot is a set of Makefiles and patches that makes it easy generate a
-	  cross-compilation toolchain and root filesystem for your target Linux
-	  system using the <a href= "http://www.uclibc.org/">uClibc C library</a>.
-	  Buildroot is useful mainly for people working with small or embedded
-	  systems.  Embedded systems often use processors that are not the regular
-	  x86 processors everyone is used to using on their PC. It can be PowerPC
-	  processors, MIPS processors, ARM processors, etc.  And to be extra safe,
-	  you do not need to be root to build or run buildroot.</p>
-
-	<p>And as of today buildroot even has its own webpage, making it a first class
-	  citizen of uclibc.org and busybox.net, and more importantly, make it easy
-	  to find and point to buildroot.</p>
-
-	<p>If you find a bug in buildroot, or wish to submit a patch
-	  to fix a problem or add a shiny new feature, please use
-	  the <a href="https://bugs.uclibc.org/">Bug and Patch
-	  Tracking System</a> to post the details, to make certain
-	  your work is not lost</p>

-=== Infrastructure for asciidoc documents
-
-[[asciidoc-documents-tutorial]]
-
-The Buildroot manual, which you are currently reading, is entirely written
-using the http://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] mark-up syntax. The manual is then
-rendered to many formats:
-
-* html
-* split-html
-* pdf
-* epub
-* text
-
-Although Buildroot only contains one document written in AsciiDoc, there
-is, as for packages, an infrastructure for rendering documents using the
-AsciiDoc syntax.
-
-Also as for packages, the AsciiDoc infrastructure is available from a
-xref:outside-br-custom[br2-external tree]. This allows documentation for
-a br2-external tree to match the Buildroot documentation, as it will be
-rendered to the same formats and use the same layout and theme.
-
-==== +asciidoc-document+ tutorial
-
-Whereas package infrastructures are suffixed with +-package+, the document
-infrastructures are suffixed with +-document+. So, the AsciiDoc infrastructure
-is named +asciidoc-document+.
-
-Here is an example to render a simple AsciiDoc document.
-

-08: $(eval $(call asciidoc-document))
-----
-
-On line 7, the Makefile declares what the sources of the document are.
-Currently, it is expected that the document's sources are only local;
-Buildroot will not attempt to download anything to render a document.
-Thus, you must indicate where the sources are. Usually, the string
-above is sufficient for a document with no sub-directory structure.
-
-On line 8, we call the +asciidoc-document+ function, which generates all
-the Makefile code necessary to render the document.
-
-==== +asciidoc-document+ reference
-
-The list of variables that can be set in a +.mk+ file to give metadata
-information is (assuming the document name is +foo+) :
-
-* +FOO_SOURCES+, mandatory, defines the source files for the document.
-
-* +FOO_RESOURCES+, optional, may contain a space-separated list of paths
-  to one or more directories containing so-called resources (like CSS or
-  images). By default, empty.
-
-* +FOO_DEPENDENCIES+, optional, the list of packages (most probably,
-  host-packages) that must be built before building this document.
-
-There are also additional hooks (see xref:hooks[] for general information
-on hooks), that a document may set to define extra actions to be done at
-various steps:
-
-* +FOO_POST_RSYNC_HOOKS+ to run additional commands after the sources
-  have been copied by Buildroot. This can for example be used to
-  generate part of the manual with information extracted from the
-  tree. As an example, Buildroot uses this hook to generate the tables
-  in the appendices.
-
-* +FOO_CHECK_DEPENDENCIES_HOOKS+ to run additional tests on required
-  components to generate the document. In AsciiDoc, it is possible to
-  call filters, that is, programs that will parse an AsciiDoc block and
-  render it appropriately (e.g. http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/[ditaa] or
-  https://pythonhosted.org/aafigure/[aafigure]).
-
-* +FOO_CHECK_DEPENDENCIES_<FMT>_HOOKS+, to run additional tests for
-  the specified format +<FMT>+ (see the list of rendered formats, above).
-
-Here is a complete example that uses all variables and all hooks:

-== Getting Buildroot
-
-Buildroot releases are made every 3 months, in February, May, August and
-November. Release numbers are in the format YYYY.MM, so for example
-2013.02, 2014.08.
-
-Release tarballs are available at http://buildroot.org/downloads/[].
-
-For your convenience, a https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrantfile] is
-available in `support/misc/Vagrantfile` in the Buildroot source tree
-to quickly set up a virtual machine with the needed dependencies to
-get started.
-
-If you want to setup an isolated buildroot environment on Linux or Mac
-Os X, paste this line onto your terminal:
-
---------------------
-curl -O https://buildroot.org/downloads/Vagrantfile; vagrant up
---------------------
-
-If you are on Windows, paste this into your powershell:
-
---------------------
-(new-object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(
-"https://buildroot.org/downloads/Vagrantfile","Vagrantfile");
-vagrant up
---------------------
-
-If you want to follow development, you can use the daily snapshots or
-make a clone of the Git repository. Refer to the
-http://buildroot.org/download[Download page] of the Buildroot website
-for more details.
