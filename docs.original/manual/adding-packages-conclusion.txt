=== Conclusion

As you can see, adding a software package to Buildroot is simply a
matter of writing a Makefile using an existing example and modifying it
according to the compilation process required by the package.

If you package software that might be useful for other people, don't
forget to send a patch to the Buildroot mailing list (see
xref:submitting-patches[])!
