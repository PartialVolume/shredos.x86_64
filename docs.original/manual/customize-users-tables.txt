=== Adding custom user accounts

Sometimes it is needed to add specific users in the target system.
To cover this requirement, Buildroot provides support for so-called
_users tables_. To use this feature, set config option
+BR2_ROOTFS_USERS_TABLES+ to a space-separated list of users tables,
regular text files following the xref:makeuser-syntax[makeusers syntax].

As shown in xref:customize-dir-structure[], the recommended location for
such files is +board/<company>/<boardname>/+.

It should be noted that if the custom users are related to a specific
application, you should set variable +FOO_USERS+ in the package's +.mk+
file instead (see xref:generic-package-reference[]).
