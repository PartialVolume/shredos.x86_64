	  c-periphery is a set of C wrapper functions for GPIO, SPI,
	  I2C, MMIO, and Serial peripheral I/O interface access in
	  userspace Linux. The c-periphery wrappers simplify and
	  consolidate the native Linux APIs to these
	  interfaces. c-periphery is useful in embedded Linux
	  environments (including BeagleBone, Raspberry Pi,
	  etc. platforms) for interfacing with external
	  peripherals. c-periphery is re-entrant, uses static
	  allocations, has no dependencies outside the standard C
	  library and Linux, compiles into a static library for easy
	  integration with other projects, and is MIT licensed.
