	  Cukinia is designed to help Linux-based embedded firmware
	  developers run system-level validation tests on their product.
	  It provides a simple POSIX shell overlay, and primitives to
	  make sure system integrations and features keep behaving the
	  way they should.

	  By default, cukinia reports colorized test results on stdout,
	  but can also report them as CSV and JUnit-XML for easy
	  integration with CI systems such as Jenkins.
