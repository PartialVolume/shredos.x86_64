	  In the modern world of responsive web design tables can often
	  cause a particular problem for designers due to their row
	  based layout.  Responsive is an extension for DataTables that
	  resolves that problem by optimising the table's layout for
	  different screen sizes through the dynamic insertion and
	  removal of columns from the table.
