	  DirectFB (Direct Frame Buffer) is a set of graphics APIs
	  implemented on top of the Linux Frame Buffer (fbdev)
	  abstraction layer. It is an alternative to X11 with a smaller
	  memory footprint that still has an integrated windowing
	  system. As of 4 October 2015, DirectFB's website
	  http://www.directfb.org/ is down. See alternative site listed
