	  exFAT filesystem utilities.

	  This is the set of user-space utilities that go together
	  with the FUSE-based exfat driver from package/exfat.

	  If you're using the exfat driver from the official Linux
	  kernel (merged as of Linux 5.7), you must use the user-space
	  utilities from package/exfatprogs.
