	  exFAT filesystem userspace utilities

	  This is the set of tools that works together with the exfat
	  driver in the official Linux kernel (merged in Linux 5.7).

	  If you're using the FUSE-based exfat support (from
	  package/exfat), you must use the corresponding user-space
	  programs in package/exfat-utils.
