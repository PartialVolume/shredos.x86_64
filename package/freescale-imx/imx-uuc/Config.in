	  This package provides the Universal Adapter user-space
	  utility that is used to receive commands from the
	  Manufacturing Tool using the Freescale UTP Protocol.

	  It requires a Freescale/NXP kernel whose configuration
	  contains the CONFIG_FSL_UTP option.

	  This package is provided by Freescale/NXP as-is and doesn't
	  have an upstream.
