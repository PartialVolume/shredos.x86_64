Subject: [PATCH] nat/fork-inferior: include linux-ptrace.h

To decide whether fork() or vfork() should be used, fork-inferior.c
uses the following test:

  #if !(defined(__UCLIBC__) && defined(HAS_NOMMU))

However, HAS_NOMMU is never defined, because it gets defined in
linux-ptrace.h, which is not included by fork-inferior.c. Due to this,
gdbserver fails to build on noMMU architectures. This commit fixes
that by simply including linux-ptrace.h.

This bug was introduced by commit
2090129c36c7e582943b7d300968d19b46160d84 ("Share fork_inferior et al
with gdbserver"). Indeed, the same fork()/vfork() selection was done,
but in another file where linux-ptrace.h was included.

Fixes the following build issue:

../nat/fork-inferior.c: In function 'pid_t fork_inferior(const char*, const string&, char**, void (*)(), void (*)(int), void (*)(), const char*, void (*)(const char*, char* const*, char* const*))':
../nat/fork-inferior.c:376:11: error: 'fork' was not declared in this scope
     pid = fork ();
           ^~~~
../nat/fork-inferior.c:376:11: note: suggested alternative: 'vfork'
     pid = fork ();
           ^~~~
           vfork
