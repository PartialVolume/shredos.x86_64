	  gloox is a portable high-level Jabber/XMPP library for C++. It
	  is fully compliant with the XMPP RFCs, supports all of the
	  XMPP features (including SRV lookups, TLS, SASL, roster
	  management, and privacy lists), and implements several XEPs
	  that make it ideal for writing any kind of Jabber/XMPP client
	  or component.
