	  Gqrx is an open source software defined radio (SDR) receiver
	  implemented using GNU Radio and the Qt GUI
	  toolkit. Currently it works on Linux and Mac with hardware
	  supported by gr-osmosdr, including Funcube Dongle, RTL-SDR,
	  Airspy, HackRF, BladeRF, RFSpace, USRP and SoapySDR.

	  Gqrx can operate as an AM/FM/SSB receiver with audio output
	  or as an FFT-only instrument. There are also various hooks
	  for interacting with external application using network
	  sockets.
