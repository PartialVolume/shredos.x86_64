	  GraphicsMagick is the swiss army knife of image processing.
	  It provides a robust and efficient collection of tools
	  and libraries which support reading, writing,
	  and manipulating an image in over 89 major formats
	  including important formats like DPX, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000,
	  PNG, PDF, PNM, TIFF, and WebP.
