	  Heirloom mailx (previously known as nail) is a mail user
	  agent for Unix systems.

	  It can be used as a command-line mail reader, but also more
	  importantly on embedded systems, as a mail composition
	  program and SMTP client, in order to send e-mail from shell
	  scripts. It supports SMTP authentication (login, plain,
	  cram-md5), SMTPS, MIME encoding of attachements, and more.
