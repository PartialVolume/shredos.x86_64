	  This is The Linux UPnP Internet Gateway Device 2. It is
	  modified from the original Linux UPnP Internet Gateway Device
	  [http://linux-igd.sourceforge.net/] according to UPnP
	  InternetGatewayDevice:2 specifications.

	  It implements the UPnP Internet Gateway Device version 2
	  specification (IGDv2) and allows UPnP aware clients, such as
	  MSN Messenger, Azureus or Miranda to work properly from behind
	  a NAT firewall.

	  Please edit /etc/upnpd.conf before using upnpd!
