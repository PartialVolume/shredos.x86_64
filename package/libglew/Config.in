	  The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW) is a
	  cross-platform C/C++ extension loading library. GLEW provides
	  efficient run-time mechanisms for determining which OpenGL
	  extensions are supported on the target platform. OpenGL core
	  and extension functionality is exposed in a single header
	  file.
