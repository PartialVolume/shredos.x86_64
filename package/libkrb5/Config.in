	  Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services
	  on a network. Kerberos is a trusted third-party service.
	  That means that there is a third party (the Kerberos server)
	  that is trusted by all the entities on the network (users
	  and services, usually called "principals"). This is the MIT
	  reference implementation of Kerberos V5.
