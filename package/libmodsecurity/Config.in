	  Libmodsecurity is one component of the ModSecurity
	  v3 project. The library codebase serves as an
	  interface to ModSecurity Connectors taking in web
	  traffic and applying traditional ModSecurity
	  processing. In general, it provides the capability
	  to load/interpret rules written in the ModSecurity
	  SecRules format and apply them to HTTP content
	  provided by your application via Connectors.
