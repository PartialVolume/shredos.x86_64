	  This is LVM2, the rewrite of The Linux Logical Volume Manager.
	  LVM supports enterprise level volume management of disk and
	  disk subsystems by grouping arbitrary disks into volume
	  groups. The total capacity of volume groups can be allocated
	  to logical volumes, which are accessed as regular block
	  devices.

	  The Linux Kernel Device Mapper is the LVM
	  (Linux Logical Volume Management) Team's implementation of a
	  minimalistic kernel-space driver that handles volume
	  management, while keeping knowledge of the underlying device
	  layout in user-space. This makes it useful for not only LVM,
	  but EVMS, software raid, and other drivers that create
	  "virtual" block devices.
