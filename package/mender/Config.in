	  Mender is an open source over-the-air (OTA) software updater
	  for embedded Linux devices. Mender comprises a client
	  running at the embedded device, as well as a server that
	  manages deployments across many devices.

	  Notes:
	  For systems using uboot as the bootloader:
	    - uboot must have the mender uboot patches applied.
	    - uboot-tools must be selected.
	    - fw_printenv must be functional on the device.
	  The Mender Uboot patches are at:
	  https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender/

	  For more information on Manual U-Boot integration, see:
	  https://docs.mender.io/2.6/system-updates-yocto-project/board-integration/bootloader-support/u-boot/manual-u-boot-integration

	  For systems using Grub2 as the bootloader:
	    - Mender depends on the mender-grubenv package.
	    - The mender-grubenv package provides a fw_printenv script,
	      which is not compatible with the uboot-tools fw_printenv
	      script.

	  The mender project recommends using uboot to load Grub2 as a
	  secondary bootloader whenever possible. Using Grub2 as a
	  secondary bootloader prevents users from porting the patches
	  for uboot to each new device.
