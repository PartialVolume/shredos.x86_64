Subject: [PATCH] Prefer ext static libs when --default-library=static

This patch adds a case in the library pattern logic to prefer static
libraries when the Meson Core option for "default_library" is set to
solely static.

The existing library search order makes sense for cases of shared and
shared / static mixed. However if using a prebuilt cross-toolchain,
they usually provide both a static and shared version of sysroot
libraries. This presents a problem in a complete static build where
there won't be shared libraries at runtime and during build time there
are failures like "ld: attempted static link of dynamic object".

Bug:
