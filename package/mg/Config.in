	  Emacs-like text editor (130 kiB)

	  Mg is a MicroEMACS clone with the goal of being compatible
	  with GNU Emacs, because there should never be any reason to
	  learn more than one Emacs flavor.

	  Unlike many other editors it does not require ncurses, only a
	  standard C library, making it suitable for really small and
	  embedded systems.

	  This version is based on mg2a from OpenBSD, with more features
	  and, in particular, no requirement on ncurses or termcap.
