	  An implementation of the DVMRP multicast routing protocol.
	  Unlike PIM a DVMRP router has a distance vector protocol (like
	  RIP) built-in to figure out the reverse-path to the multicast
	  source. This package comes with mrouted and mroutectl.  Where
	  the latter is used to query status and control operation.

	  Note: at least two interfaces with MULTICAST flag is requried.
