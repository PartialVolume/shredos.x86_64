	  nodm is a minimal display manager that simply logs in
	  as a given user and starts an X session, without asking
	  for username or password.

	  For those cases where automatic login is needed (and
	  does not imply a security issue), nodm is simple to setup,
	  lightweight, and it should do exactly the right thing.
