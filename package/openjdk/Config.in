config BR2_PACKAGE_OPENJDK_FULL_JDK
	bool "Build the full JDK"
	help
	  Install the full JDK instead of just the run time.
	  The full JDK includes several packages used for debugging and
	  development. Some useful tools included with the JDK are:
	    - javaws
	      Command line tool for launching Java Web Start and setting
	      various options.

	    - jcmd:
	      JVM Diagnostic Commands tool: Sends diagnostic command
	      requests to a running Java Virtual Machine.

	    - jinfo
	      Configuration Info for Java: Prints configuration
	      information for a given process or core file or a remote
	      debug server.

	    - jmap
	      Memory Map for Java: Prints shared object memory maps or
	      heap memory details of a given process or core file or a
	      remote debug server.

	    - jsadebugd
	      Serviceability Agent Debug Daemon for Java: Attaches to a
	      process or core file and acts as a debug server.

	    - jstack
	      Stack Trace for Java - Prints a stack trace of threads for
	      a given process or core file or remote debug server.

	    - jstat
	      JVM Statistics Monitoring Tool: Attaches to an
	      instrumented HotSpot Java virtual machine and collects and
	      logs performance statistics as specified by the command
	      line options.

	    - jstatd
	      JVM jstat Daemon - Launches an RMI server application that
	      monitors for the creation and termination of instrumented
	      HotSpot Java virtual machines and provides an interface to
	      allow remote monitoring tools to attach to Java virtual
	      machines running on the local system.

	  Note:
	  While the JDK also comes with several tools which can be used
	  for developing java applications on a target, Buildroot does
	  not support development on a target. Building the full JDK is
	  supported for debugging purposes only.

	  Selecting this option increases the file system by
	  approximately 110M.
