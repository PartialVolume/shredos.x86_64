	  This build option enables OP-TEE test package from the
	  OP-TEE project. It helps platforms to verify the OP-TEE
	  installation against a set of regression and performance
	  tests.

	  The package generates userspace test applications and
	  data files for the Linux userland. It also generates
	  OP-TEE trusted applications.

	  Trusted application binary files are installed in the target
	  directory /lib/optee_armtz as other trusted applications.
	  At runtime OP-TEE OS can load trusted applications from this
	  non-secure filesystem/directory into the secure world for
	  execution.
