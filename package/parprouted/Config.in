	  parprouted is a daemon for transparent IP (Layer 3) proxy ARP
	  bridging. This is useful for creation of transparent firewalls
	  and bridging networks with different MAC protocols. Also,
	  unlike standard bridging, proxy ARP bridging allows to bridge
	  Ethernet networks behind wireless nodes without using WDS or
	  layer 2 bridging.
