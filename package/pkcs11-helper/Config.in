	help
	  pkcs11-helper is a library that simplifies the interaction
	  with PKCS#11 providers for end-user applications.

	  pkcs11-helper allows using multiple PKCS#11 providers at the
	  same time, enumerating available token certificates, or
	  selecting a certificate directly by serialized id, handling
	  card removal and card insert events, handling card re-insert
	  to a different slot, supporting session expiration and much
	  more all using a simple API.

	  pkcs11-helper is not designed to manage card content, since
	  object attributes are usually vendor specific, and 99% of
	  application need to access existing objects in order to
	  perform signature and decryption.
