	  Minimalistic protocol buffer decoder and encoder in C++.
	  Designed for high performance. Suitable for writing zero copy
	  parsers and encoders with minimal need for run-time allocation
	  of memory.
	  Low-level: this is designed to be a building block for writing
	  a very customized decoder for a stable protobuf schema. If
	  your protobuf schema is changing frequently or lazy decoding
	  is not critical for your application then this approach offers
	  no value: just use the C++ API that can be generated with
	  the Google Protobufs protoc program.
