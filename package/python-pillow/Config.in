	  Pillow is the "friendly" PIL fork by Alex Clark and
	  Contributors. PIL is the Python Imaging Library by Fredrik
	  Lundh and Contributors.

	  Pillow relies on external libraries to provide support
	  various image formats. Select the corresponding package(s)
	  to get this support. Pillow can use jpeg, zlib (for PNG),
	  tiff, freetype, webp, and openjpeg (JPEG-2000).
