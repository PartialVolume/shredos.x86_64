Subject: [PATCH] Abort on failed module build

When building a Python module fails, the setup.py script currently
doesn't exit with an error, and simply continues. This is not a really
nice behavior, so this patch changes setup.py to abort with an error,
so that the build issue is clearly noticeable.
