Subject: [PATCH] fix building on older distributions

Python > 3.6.3 calls os.replace in the update_file.py script, during the
regen-importlib phase of the build process.

According to Doc/whatsnew/3.3.rst line 1631, os.replace acts in the same
way as os.rename, however, it is now cross-platform compatible for Windows.

Because BuildRoot is guaranteed only to be built in  POSIX environment, it is
safe to change os.replace back to os.rename.

This change fixes building on older systems such as CentOS7, that only come
with python 2.
