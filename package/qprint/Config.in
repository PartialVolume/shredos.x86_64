	  qprint is a program that encodes and decodes binary data in
	  the Quoted-Printable encoding, defined as a part of the MIME
	  specification in RFC 1521. This encoding allows for efficient
	  transfer of mostly ASCII data over transports that are only
	  7-bit clean, like SMTP without 8BITMIME or BINARYMIME
	  extensions. It also allows the transfer of long lines of text
	  by wrapping them every 76 characters.

	  Usually, a sophisticated MUA will take care of automatically
	  choosing the best encodings for an e-mail. Nevertheless, this
	  utility may be useful when a MTA (e.g. msmtp) is used without
	  a MUA, or if using this encoding for other purposes is
	  desired.
