	  Qt is a cross-platform application and UI framework for
	  developers using C++.

	  The Qt KNX module implements the client side of a connection
	  between a client and a KNXnet/IP server. This connection
	  can be used to send messages to the KNX bus and to control
	  the functionalities of the KNX devices.
