	  Qt is a cross-platform application and UI framework for
	  developers using C++.

	  The Qt WebSockets module provides C++ and QML interfaces
	  that enable Qt applications to act as a server that can
	  process WebSocket requests, or a client that can
	  consume data received from the server, or both.
