	depends on BR2_PACKAGE_READLINE
	help
	  Enable the "bracketed paste" feature in libreadline.

	  Bracketed paste is helpful for interactive sessions when
	  one wants to prevent pasted text from being interpreted
	  as typed-in commands. However, it also causes control
	  characters to show up in the raw output of a (telnet)
	  session. This can cause issues and throw off pattern
	  matching if the session output is being captured for
	  automated processing.

	  For further information on this feature and whether you
	  may want it, see:
