	  Set of utilities for testing the real-time behaviour of a
	  Linux system.

	  All tools are simple C programs with no dependencies, except
	  the hwlatdetect utility, which is a Python script and
	  therefore requires the Python interpreter. It will only be
	  installed if a Python interpreter has been selected in the
	  Buildroot configuration.

	  Note that this package requires a toolchain built with the
	  NPTL implementation of the pthread API (this is always the
	  case with glibc toolchains, but may not necessarily be the
	  case with uClibc toolchains, since the thread implementation
	  is configurable).
