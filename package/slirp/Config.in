	  NOTE:
	  This package has some history of a unique kind:
	    - originally developped as 'slirp' by Danny Gasparovski, and
	      seemingly abandonned (developper /disapeared/)
	    - then re-maintained at sourceforge by "Kelly", up to some
	      time around 2009: http://slirp.sourceforge.net/
	    - during that period, QEMU (Fabrice BELLARD) forked the code
	      and included it in QEMU
	    - and it was imported from this breed by the Spice project
	      around May 2009 which archived it in 2012
	    - So we switched to
	      https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/slirp/libslirp
