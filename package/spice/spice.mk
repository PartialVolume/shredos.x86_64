# It is currently not possible to detect if stack-protection is available
# or not, because it requires support from both the compiler *and* the
# C library, but the C library (eg. uClibc) can be compiled without that
# support, even if gcc accepts the -fstack-protector-all option.
# spice's ./configure only checks for gcc's -fstack-protector-all option,
# so it misses the case where the C library doe not provide the requires
# support.
# A correct fix would be to fix spice's ./configure to also check the C
# library, but it might be much more involved.
# So, we simply disable it for now. After all, as uClibc's help puts it:
#     Note that NOEXECSTACK on a kernel with address space randomization
#     is generally sufficient to prevent most buffer overflow exploits
#     without increasing code size.
