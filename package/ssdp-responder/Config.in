	  Simple Service Discovery Protocol daemon (SSDP) for networked
	  Linux and UNIX devices. Useful in any setup, big or small, but
	  targeted more at embedded systems that need to announce
	  themselves to Windows systems.

	  ssdpd is a stand-alone UNIX, no external dependencies but the
	  standard C library.  It has a built-in web server for serving
	  the UPnP XML description which Windows use to present the
	  icon, by default an InternetGatewayDevice is announced.

	  Also included is ssdp-scan, a tool similar to mdns-scan, which
	  continuously scans for SSDP capable hosts on the network.
	  Take care only to use for debugging since it scans the network
	  quite aggressively.
