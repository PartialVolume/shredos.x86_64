	  The continuation of the original sysklogd package, based on
	  the original Berkeley syslog daemon. Now with kernel
	  logging, and log rotation built-in. It can both receive from
	  and send to remote syslog servers. The v2.x series include
	  extended support for RFC5424 with an alt. syslogp() API for

	  Retry delay (seconds) for sending to remote syslog servers.

	  When set up to forward logs to a remote syslog server, the
	  network may not always be available. E.g., default interface
	  down, or no route to the remote server. This setting controls
	  the back-off time before retrying.

	  Default: 180 seconds

	bool "logger tool"
	help
	  Generate log messages from scripts or from the command line.

	  This version of logger is receommended for use with sysklogd.
	  It makes use of the new syslogp() API for RFC5424 style logs,
	  e.g. MSGID, strucutred data (SD), etc.

	  The BusyBox, or util-linux, logger tools can also be used, but
	  are limited to RFC3164 style messages.
