	  systemd is a system and service manager for Linux,
	  compatible with SysV and LSB init scripts. systemd provides
	  aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket and
	  D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand
	  starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux
	  cgroups, supports snapshotting and restoring of the system
	  state, maintains mount and automount points and implements
	  an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control
	  logic.  It can work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.

	  Systemd requires a Linux kernel >= 3.0 with the following
	  options enabled:

	  - CONFIG_CGROUPS
	  - CONFIG_INOTIFY_USER
	  - CONFIG_FHANDLE
	  - CONFIG_AUTOFS4_FS
	  - CONFIG_TMPFS_POSIX_ACL
	  - CONFIG_TMPFS_XATTR

	  These options will be automatically enabled by Buildroot if
	  it is responsible for building the kernel. Otherwise, if you
	  are building your kernel outside of Buildroot, make sure
	  these options are enabled.

	  Systemd also provides udev, the userspace device daemon.

	  The selection of other packages will enable some features:

	  - acl package will add support for multi-seat.
	  - xz and/or l4 packages will add compression support in
	    journal and coredump.
	  - libcurl package will add support for systemd-journal-upload.
	  - libgcrypt package will add support for journal sealing and
	    DNSSEC verification in resolved.

	  Notice that systemd selects the fsck wrapper from util-linux
	  but no particular fsck.<fstype> is selected. You must choose
	  the apropriate ones (e.g. e2fsck, from the e2fsprogs
	  package) according to the system configuration.
