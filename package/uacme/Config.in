	  uacme is a client for the ACMEv2 protocol described in
	  RFC8555, written in plain C with minimal dependencies
	  (libcurl and either of GnuTLS, OpenSSL or mbedTLS). The
	  ACMEv2 protocol allows a Certificate Authority
	  (https://letsencrypt.org is a popular one) and an applicant
	  to automate the process of verification and certificate
	  issuance.
