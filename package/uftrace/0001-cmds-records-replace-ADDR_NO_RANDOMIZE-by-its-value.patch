Subject: [PATCH] cmds/records: replace ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE by its value

uClibc-ng lacks the definition of ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE, causing a build
failure. A patch was submitted to upstream uClibc-ng to address this
issue, but in the mean time, use an hardcoded value.

Using a #ifdef ... #endif test doesn't work as this value is defined
through an enum in glibc.
