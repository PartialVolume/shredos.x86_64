	  Some USB devices such as 3G/4G broadband modems power-up
	  in mass storage mode to provide access to drivers
	  for the device's application mode. usb_modeswitch
	  changes the mode of such devices from the initial power-up
	  mode to the application mode.
	  Specific configuration data for each device model is required.

	  usb_modeswitch can be used with the usb_modeswitch_data
	  package and eudev/systemd for automatic mode switching
	  when devices are connected.

	  For more information search the Internet for "Virtual CD-ROM
	  switching utility".
