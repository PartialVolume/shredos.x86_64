	  Silicon Labs WF111 WiFi driver and utilities.

	  Warning: CONFIG_WIRELESS_EXT and CONFIG_WEXT_PRIV must be
	  selected in the Linux kernel configuration. These are blind
	  options (i.e. not selectable directly) so they cannot be
	  enabled by a change in linux/linux.mk. There are two choices
	  to enable these options:
	  - By making them non blind, with a "WF111 support"
	    configuration entry that selects them, for example.
	  - By enabling another random WiFi driver that select them.
