	  XorCurses is a game remake of the 8-bit game 'Xor'. Your task
	  is to roam around a series of mazes where you have to collect
	  all blue masks before finding the exit. Note that the game
	  needs a terminal with colors, i.e. make sure that the TERM
	  environment variable is set to "linux" ("vt100" won't work).
