#!/usr/bin/env bash
# A little script I whipped up to make it easy to
# patch source trees and have sane error handling
# -Erik
#
# (c) 2002 Erik Andersen <andersen@codepoet.org>
#
# Parameters:
# - "-s", optional. Silent operation, don't print anything if there
# isn't any error.
# - the build directory, optional, default value is '.'. The place where are
# the package sources.
# - the patch directory, optional, default '../kernel-patches'. The place
# where are the scripts you want to apply.
# - other parameters are the patch name patterns, optional, default value is
# '*'. Pattern(s) describing the patch names you want to apply.
#
# The script will look recursively for patches from the patch directory. If a
# file named 'series' exists then the patches mentioned in it will be applied
# as plain patches, regardless of their file name. If no 'series' file exists,
# the script will look for file names matching pattern(s). If the name
# ends with '.tar.*', '.tbz2' or '.tgz', the file is considered as an archive
# and will be uncompressed into a directory named
# '.patches-name_of_the_archive-unpacked'. It's the turn of this directory to
# be scanned with '*' as pattern. Remember that scanning is recursive. Other
# files than series file and archives are considered as a patch.
#
# Once a patch is found, the script will try to apply it. If its name doesn't
# end with '.gz', '.bz', '.bz2', '.xz', '.zip', '.Z', '.diff*' or '.patch*',
# it will be skipped. If necessary, the patch will be uncompressed before being
# applied. The list of the patches applied is stored in '.applied_patches_list'
# file in the build directory.
